Yeah, walking Baguio can still feel scattered, but it mostly feels arranged. Due to the city&rsquo;s smallness, familiarity with spaces becomes easy, and with that familiarity comes indescribable comfort. In other words, walking Baguio doesn&rsquo;t feel as messy as walking Manila. This comparison is important because Baguio and Manila were the first guinea pigs of American-enforced city planning, the goal of which was to paint in the minds of the newly colonized that everything was okay and beautiful. With this historical knowledge, one might say the Americans found more success in Baguio. <em>Beckoning Baguio</em> is a reminder, though, that the city of pines, as pretty as it is, is mired by the same problems recognizable throughout the country&rsquo;s many urban landscapes. If this is a walking book, then it would move the reader to walk and, specifically, to walk Baguio. When the reader ever reaches that point, I think of no better companion than these essays.</p><hr><p>2.1</p><p>Swedish proverb:</p><p>&ldquo;No one becomes a good doctor before he fills a churchyard.&rdquo;</p><p>2.2</p><p>Journal, 6 October 2024:</p><p>Raining outside and natural light is scarcer than usual.

Already, in the hallway, I can smell it, and walking down the hallway and into the living room, the odor is strong: brownies, freshly baked brownies, warm and waiting for us. Such a delight. Such a welcoming, beckoning house to walk into. It says, “welcome”—the brownies do. But of course, if brownies, then a time to eat them, and to chat and laugh and thereby to be at home.</p><p>There is other food on the table awaiting the mid-evening break: melon, raw carrots, freshly washed grapes, coffee, tea, soda, orange juice and, as I said, chatter and laughter. At the break, we will have been writing together—the ten or twelve of us—for an hour or so, having been invited to respond to some lines from a poem or a book, or to some pictures or to several articles: ancient kitchen utensils, old fashioned toys and children’s books, a line from a song, the song itself.

We can, easily understand that such a Christian-centric attitude is quite natural for European Christians who think much of their past history and tradition, because non-Christian liberals in Japan are also much attached to their own history and tradition.</p><p>We are, therefore, very anxious to have the word “Christianity” dropped from the name of I.A.R.F. If the word “Christianity” remains un-dropped, we shall be obliged to cancel the invitation of the 19th Congress in 1967 to Tokyo (as I announced unofficially in 1961 at Davos Congress) because non-Christian members of Japan Free Religious Association and religious circles at large in Japan will not cooperate.</p><p>4.2</p><p>[[my vision statement|My vision statement]]:</p><p>I have brought to life a creative [[spirituality]]—a way of life—customized to my needs, personality, and strengths.

It is a creed without a God. I have faith in self, in other people, in society. There is no God in my creed. However, if one believes that the universe is religion, then if it is necessary to use the word ‘God’, I see no objection. Then man is God, society is God and the universe is God.</p><p>The founder of Konkokyo, Kawate Bunjiro, pointed out that the kami is dependent on the adherents and the adherents are dependent on the kami. It is understandable how the adherents are dependent on the kami, but it is not clear how the kami is dependent on the adherents unless one realizes that the founder meant that the kami and the adherents are inter-dependent. This can be interpreted as meaning that God depends on the believers, and the believers should be worthy of this regard.”</p><p>5.2</p><p>Journal, 13 October 2024:</p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been introduced to the idea that [[animism]], which describes precolonial Filipino spirituality, could be a resource for [[my jiyu shukyo|my jiyū shūkyō]] project, particularly because of its similarities with [[pantheism]].

If there is liberal Shinto then there could be—at least with my personal [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]] project—be a liberal Filipino animism or whatever it is called. In such a progressive remaking of our precolonial spirituality, what I want to emphasize is the pantheistic elements—that nature is divine and that humans are part of that larger nature, intricately connected to it, in fact.</p><hr><p>6.1</p><p>[[henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee]]:</p><p>Get it down.

Too much doing-focus will crowd out the expansive mindset which generates new insights. <a href=https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zWzVw2VM4TPjpKXnHUfLaso target=_blank rel=noreferrer>It’s hard to hear yourself think</a>.</p><p>8.2</p><p>[[my jiyu shukyo|My jiyū shūkyō]]:</p><p>Since creating my jiyū shūkyō will be a long and winding process, it&rsquo;s unwise to treat it like a [[04 notes/project]]. It&rsquo;s best maintained or supervised as a [[life area]]. Success in this endeavor isn&rsquo;t measured by finishing or reaching an end point but by maintaining a certain standard. In this case, my standard for my jiyū shūkyō could be something like a portion of [[my mission statement]]: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged every day in a pursuit of wisdom, meaning, and beauty.&rdquo;</p><p>Specifically, success in my jiyū shūkyō area includes the following:</p><ul><li>maintenance of contemplative practices like [[seiza]] and [[04 notes/walking]]</li><li>maintenance of mindful [[reading]], [[journaling]], and studying through my [[talahardin]]</li><li>maintenance of practices through communities and others</li><li>maintenance of creative practices involving walking, [[writing]], and [[photography]]</li></ul><p>But how do I study in a way that makes me feel that I&rsquo;m not constricted, that I&rsquo;m allowed to flow and follow my curiosities, while maintaining a measure of focus?</p><p>In the creation of my jiyū shūkyō, I need to let go of this desire for blueprints. Spirituality and answers to how to live are best left unblueprinted. I should have faith that this process will result to something. As long as I follow my curiosities and authenticity, I will eventually focus.</p><hr><p>9.1</p><p>[[isabelo de los reyes|Isabelo de los Reyes]]:</p><p>The ancient chronicles of Jesuit and Hispanic friars say that upon the arrival of the first Spaniards, the coasts of the Visayas and even in Manila, there were many converts to Mohammedanism, and even more could be found in Mindanao that were converted by the islamic teachers from Borneo. So, if we are to find the true Philippine religion at its purest, we must look to the mountainous regions of the North. Knowing how to distinguish the True Religion from those that were influenced by the Hindu, Mohammedan and Christian grafts can be difficult, but the true Philippine religion is still intact, not only among the Itnegs (Tinguians), but in the legends, advices and superstitions of the Tagalog&rsquo;s, Visayan&rsquo;s, Bicolano&rsquo;s, Kapampangan&rsquo;s, Zambaleno&rsquo;s, Pangasinero&rsquo;s and other Filipino ethnic groups.</p><p>9.2</p><p>Journal, 18 October 2024:</p><p>Precolonial Filipino spirituality had Hindu and Buddhist influence. There is some proof that our culture was closely influenced by South Asian culture. Ancient Filipino religion must have been syncretic—a mix of [[anitism]], [[hinduism]], [[buddhism]], and some [[islam]], particularly in the south. One could only imagine what our society looked like without the coming of [[christianity|Christianity]]. Maybe we are a country of contemplatives, growing up from homes where we both meditated but also believe in [[bathala|Bathala]] or Laon or Kabunian—perhaps something like Tibetan Buddhism. A mix of animitism and Buddhism would produce something like this. And since none of these ancient religions are colonial, they wouldn&rsquo;t destroy each other. All would&rsquo;ve flourished and will have more resources today for creating religions of the future or individual spiritualities.</p><hr><p>10.1</p><p><a href=https://thepointmag.com/examined-life/a-world-without-why/ target=_blank rel=noreferrer>Raymond Guess</a>:</p><p>So the experience I have of my everyday work environment is of a conformist, claustrophobic and repressive verbal universe, a penitential domain of reason-mongering in which hyperactivity in detail—the endlessly repeated shouts of &ldquo;why,&rdquo; the rebuttals, calls for &ldquo;evidence,&rdquo; qualifications and quibbles—stands in stark contrast to the immobility and self-referentiality of the structure as a whole. I suffer from recurrent bouts of nausea in the face of this densely woven tissue of &ldquo;arguments,&rdquo; most of which are nothing but blinds for something else altogether, generally something unsavory; and I feel an urgent need to exit from it altogether.</p><p>10.2</p><p>Journal, 31 October 2024:</p><p>In creative writing, the need to produce something that is understandable is akin to an obsession with ratiocination observable in analytic philosophy. A perfectly linear and understandable piece of writing has some semblance to a bulletproof philosophical argumentation. While there is some comfort from reading both pieces, the desire to make sense could be nauseating, especially when most works produced are saturated by this slavery to function and reason.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/papa-isio.jpg data-pswp-width=1034 data-pswp-height=1387 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/uman/023/images/papa-isio_hu_ef2dae46b1f066b3.webp 330w,/uman/023/images/papa-isio_hu_9affc919c9c3ab1.webp 660w
