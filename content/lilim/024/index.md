## A Photograph

Look closer. A yellow boat is docked on the tiny pier. That tint of yellow on the deck is special—brighter than the already dirtied hull. And that white roof—oh, good choice of color! Not only is it pleasing in the eye, but I also bet it’s cooler inside than most boats. But look closer. The tied is higher than usual, and there’s a new concrete on the pier, where there were once just rocks, lots of them. The lake is calm as usual. The sky calmer. Although cloudy. But they’re not too low as to cover the beautiful blue mountains in the background. Lea and I just sat there, feeding our eyes with all the colors, topping them all with the cool breeze that made tiny waves that hit the pier. It was getting dark and people were starting to flock around the newly built garden where we sat. A Chinese egret from nowhere flew very low in front of us. And then it was gone.

## A Thought

This is the last issue of Lilim for its second season. I am not sure if there will be a third season. I’ll be taking a break from sending newsletters. This was a fun experiment—six months of them. But I feel like I need to do a little bit more thinking about the kind of writing I want to do and bring out to the world.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for looking at my photographs and reading my words and the quotes I share with you. I really appreciate it. For those of you who sent me emails, they meant a lot to me and I enjoy talking to you one-on-one through the written word. It’s one of the main reasons why I send a newsletter.

Thank you! Be safe out there.
