## A Photograph

![Makiling and cows](images/Makiling-and-cows.jpg)

The beauty of a poem

Is not in the words chosen

Or the rhythm

Or metaphors

Or syllables

Or in the sounds

Of hands applauding

From behind the reader’s eyes


It is not even in the breath

That flows within the poet

As he breathes out the words


No, we cannot know for sure

for the beauty of a poem

He alone sees it

No one else can


And it has to be that way

For he who cannot see beauty

by himself

Cannot show the world


## A Thought

**There is no single purpose everyone must follow, and it is highly plausible that the universe has no predetermined destiny for each of us.**

What seems to the case is that we enter life with a tabula rasa, and we create what we paint on it. An evidence for this might be the fact that as children, we don’t think about purpose. In fact, We only think about purpose when we are existentially lost—something a child is incapable of doing simply because a child is incapable of being existentially lost. A child follows what feels good and interesting.

## A Quote

## A Question
