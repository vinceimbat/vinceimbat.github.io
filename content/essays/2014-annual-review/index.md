As 2014 is bidding farewell, the blogosphere is filled with people making their annual reviews. Among the many reviews I was able to read were those of Leo Babauta, Chris Guillebeau, and Scott Dinsmore.

In simple terms, an annual review is a practice done usually at the end of the year, which aims to look at the different things that transpired in one's life over the course of an entire year. The review consists of three parts:

1. What went well throughout the year?
2. What went wrong throughout the year?
3. What will the coming year look like?

## Guide For Your Annual Review

There are several awesome guides that could help you write your own annual review but for me, only two were really notable.

First is Chris Guillebeau's process. What he does is that at the end of the year, he withdraws in a cabin in the woods for a week and does his annual review using a fairly simple template in the form of a spreadsheet and which he makes available for download at his site.

If you are interested, check out the template [here](http://chrisguillebeau.com/2014-annual-review-is-here/) as well as his really interesting annual review for 2014 [here](http://chrisguillebeau.com/2014-annual-review-lessons-learned/). Chris is really an achieved person. Having published several New York Times bestsellers, I think his annual review is worth checking out.

The best template for me I think is Scott Dinsmore's free workbook. Aside from the usual successes and failures roundup, he really guides you throughout goal-setting and weekly planning, which shows you how dedicated Scott really is in terms of the actual realization of your dreams and aspirations. I used it for doing my own annual review and I highly recommend his workbook. Get the free PDF files [here](http://liveyourlegend.net/2015-goal-setting-and-weekly-planning-workbook-downloads/).

## What Went Wrong In 2014?

With all the successes I had the past year, here are their negative counterparts. Many of these were not necessarily bad. The truth is that the biggest failures we have are actually also our biggest successes because they ultimately point us in the right direction.

Here are my failures throughout the year and I'm happy I had them.

1. I feel some regret for not pursuing some available jobs.
2. I thought I could live in Manila with very little cash but I was wrong.
3. I was not able to control my anger and I waged war with my neighbors which made them very defensive and which makes it difficult to talk peace with them today.
4. I failed to maintain my lifestyle and I have to move out of the house and the town because situations were getting worse.
5. I failed with creating a good blog many times because I did not know what I was doing and I just experimented along the way.
6. I assumed that starting a business was easy but it was way more difficult.
7. I failed in building a really quality relationship with my girlfriend.
8. I failed in building deeper relationships with my family, relatives, and friends.
9. I was not able to surround myself with the right people.
10. I was not able to build a mastermind group who would support me as I pursue my dreams and goals.
11. I was not able to build any savings.
12. I was not able to pay for my monthly health insurance regularly.
13. I did not achieve any financial goals this year.
14. My physical and mental health was poor the majority of the year.
15. I was not able to make significant progress in some passions and skills I wanted to develop.
