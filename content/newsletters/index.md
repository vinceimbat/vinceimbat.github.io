## Active newsletters

I have two active newsletters, which you get when you leave your email address below.

### Uman (monthly) — January 2022 to Present (23 issues)

_**Uman**_ is the Pangasinan word for change. I started it to keep track of the monthly changes I undergo in my projects, studies, and goals but it became this exercise that weaves spirituality, walking, writing, and photography in an essay.

Check the _**Uman**_ archives [here](uman).

### The Long Walk (occasional) — October 2022 to Present (38 issues)

_**The Long Walk**_ is a newsletter I send occasionally. It contains new or work-in-progress essays, poems, short notes, and photographs. I also share announcements about new walks in this newsletter.

Check the _**The Long Walk**_ archives [here](tlw).

Consider subscribing. It's free. Unsubscribe any time.

## Archived Newsletters

### but Overall is beyond me (bOibm) — January 25 to 31, 2025 (7 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my second week-long walk of Los Baños that ran from January 25–31, 2025. Unlike Roots ྾ Gravel, bOibm featured shorter and slower walks in six of the most silent routes in LB.

Check the **but Overall is beyond me** archives [here](boibm).

### Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1  — January 15 to 21, 2024 (5 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk of Baguio City. In this newsletter, I wrote about how I returned to streets and places I used to frequent as a former minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

Check the _**Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1**_ archives [here](tt1).

### Roots ྾ Gravel (R྾G) — December 4 to 10, 2023 (8 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk around Los Baños. The original intention of the walk was to explore a free, creative, and subsistent spirituality through walking around my current town of residence. The essays and photographs diverted from this original intention as the walk progressed.

Check the _**Roots ྾ Gravel**_ archives [here](rxg1).

### Lilim (weekly) — May 2021 to August 2022 (32 issues)

*Lilim* is a Filipino word that means shade. It was a weekly newsletter that ran for three seasons during the pandemic. It began as a documentation of my early walks in Los Baños and evolved into a predecessor of The Long Walk.
