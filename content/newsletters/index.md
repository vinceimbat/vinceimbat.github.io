## Active newsletters

I have two active newsletters, which you get when you leave your email address below.

### Umán (monthly) — January 2022 to Present (25 issues)

_**Umán**_ is a Pangasinan word that means to change, repair, or repeat. I started it in 2022 to keep track of the monthly progress of my projects and studies but it later became this experimental weaving of the creative artifacts I produce from my daily studies, readings, journaling, and walks.

Check the _**Umán**_ archives [here](uman).

### The Long Walk (occasional) — October 2022 to Present (42 issues)

_**The Long Walk**_ is a newsletter featuring essays engaging with specific subject matters related to walking, literature, photography, and spirituality. They are published spontaneously to accommodate the natural arrival and progress of my thinking on such matters. I also use this newsletter to announce upcoming walks, new projects, and new writings.

Check the _**The Long Walk**_ archives [here](tlw).

Consider subscribing to both newsletters. They're free and you can unsubscribe any time.

## Archived Newsletters

### but Overall is beyond me (bOibm) — January 25 to 31, 2025 (7 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my second week-long walk of Los Baños that ran from January 25–31, 2025. Unlike Roots ྾ Gravel, bOibm featured shorter and slower walks in six of the most silent routes in LB.

Check the **but Overall is beyond me** archives [here](boibm).

### Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1  — January 15 to 21, 2024 (5 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk of Baguio City. In this newsletter, I wrote about how I returned to streets and places I used to frequent as a former minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

Check the _**Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1**_ archives [here](tt1).

### Roots ྾ Gravel (R྾G) — December 4 to 10, 2023 (8 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk around Los Baños. The original intention of the walk was to explore a free, creative, and subsistent spirituality through walking around my current town of residence. The essays and photographs diverted from this original intention as the walk progressed.

Check the _**Roots ྾ Gravel**_ archives [here](rxg1).

### Lilim (weekly) — May 2021 to August 2022 (32 issues)

*Lilim* is a Filipino word that means shade. It was a weekly newsletter that ran for three seasons during the pandemic. It began as a documentation of my early walks in Los Baños and evolved into a predecessor of The Long Walk.
