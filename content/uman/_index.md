title: Umán

_**Umán**_ is a Pangasinan word that means to change, repair, or repeat. I started it in 2022 to keep track of the monthly progress of my projects and studies but it later became this experimental weaving of the creative artifacts I produce from my daily studies, readings, journaling, and walks.
