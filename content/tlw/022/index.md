Walking back from buying  
meat and vegetables for lunch  
this morning at Data Street,  
I shut the umbrella close  
as a thick cloud covers the sun  
passing by breezily above us,  
above the tiny store  
under a fertile rambutan,  
where old women whose children  
have all but flown away,  
nest alongside each other  
recounting better days,  
while a middle-aged man  
on a bicycle arrives  
asking whether tomatoes  
have dropped in price,  
all of which transpires  
as the cloud finally  
reaches Makiling's highest peak  
on the backdrop where it shall stay  
hovering a little while longer  
this morning.
