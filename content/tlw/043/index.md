Hi, friend. This is still [Vince Imbat](/) and you are receiving this because long ago (or recently?) you subscribed to [The Long Walk](tlw), an occasional newsletter on walking, literature, photography, and spirituality.

Last June 28, 2025, while the Pride March was happening at Quezon City here in the Philippines, I was invited by the [Global Network of Rainbow Catholics (GNRC)](https://rainbowcatholics.org/) through its Contemplative Spiritual Formation committee to give a talk. Argel Tuason, a new friend and collaborator whom I met just this month, extended the invitation and asked me to talk about [jiyū shūkyō](https://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/p/free-religion.html), the foundation of the spirituality and religious life I'm building. I decided to share my encounter with it, which is best represented by the three walks I did from 2022 to 2025.

You can watch or listen to the talk below. I've also published the talk's video and transcript as an essay in [my website](essays/encountering-a-creative-free-spirituality-jiyu-shukyo-through-walking).

One of the thirteen people who attended the talk via Zoom told me during the free conversation that followed that my journey could be a template for a lot of spiritual journeys even among people from the LGBTQ+ community in his tradition. I felt very privileged to hear this. While I use he/him pronouns, I've always felt fellow-feeling with people in the LGBTQ+ community, so much so that several of my closest collaborators and friends are active members there.

The first time I talked about my story in front of a crowd of strangers was in a writers workshop, where one of the panelists, Jhoanna Lynn Cruz, is one of if not the leading lesbian writer in the Philippines. Reading her book _[Abi Nako](https://press.up.edu.ph/product/abi-nako-or-so-i-thought/)_, which talked about her journey toward authenticity, coming out from her marriage and relocating from Baguio City to Davao City to begin a new life, spoke strongly to my desire to become my truest self and to be brave in speaking my truth.

And so to be given a chance to talk about my journey in front of the GNRC is a huge privilege, one that I hope to continue doing in the years ahead.
