I hear the tiny drops of rain  
one after the other  
then together over the large  
grown leaves of the noni.  

They mumble a silent prayer  
perhaps for a sunnier day    
for the sky has been so dark  
for a very long time now.  

If the rain could only speak  
what would it tell me?  
And what if it does speak  
and these tiny drops its words?  

And by staying put on this mat  
spread on this wooden floor  
where I sit cross-legged  
listening intently to whatever comes  

I might, if I'm ever fortunate,  
hear a whisper of a lifetimeâ€”  
the rain speaking a barely audible  
"I love you."
