Argel Tuason, a new friend and collaborator whom I met just this month, extended the invitation and asked me to talk about jiyū shūkyō, the foundation of the spirituality and religious life I\u0026rsquo;m building. I decided to share my encounter with it, which is best represented by the three walks I did from 2022 to 2025.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve provided both the recording of the talk and its text below. The Zoom recording wasn\u0026rsquo;t working, so my partner and I had to hack the recording at the last minute using the built-in screen recording on Mac. Unfortunately, our recording captured my partner blowing her nose and coughing! Haha. Apologies for this. The rainy season in the Philippines means viruses abound. I managed to edit out all of the coughs, but the blowing of the nose is harder as it intersected with my speech. I hope the interruptions don\u0026rsquo;t disturb much of your listening.\nThank you, Argel, and thank you, everyone, for coming. A big thanks, of course, to the Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, particularly its Contemplative Spiritual Formation committee, for arranging this talk and inviting me.\nSince I\u0026rsquo;ll be talking about walking today, I thought I would be amiss not to mention that hundreds of thousands gathered and walked on the streets of Manila a while ago for this year\u0026rsquo;s Pride March here in the Philippines. As you know, this form of communal walking is an integral part of the LGBTQ+ community\u0026rsquo;s history worldwide. In the Philippines, as is around the world, the Pride March serves as a space for safe gender expression and celebration, while also being a form of protest against the continued injustices that the community faces.\nAs a super fan of walking, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but marvel at how the simple act of moving one foot in front of the other while being together could and has changed societies worldwide. The power of walking, I think, lies in its simplicity and inevitability.\nMy talk tonight, as the title suggests, is about walking. However, I\u0026rsquo;ll be dedicating the time given to me today to talk about solitary walking and how it has particularly affected me as a religious and spiritual person, like all of you are. I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing three walks I did in the past four years and share how they led me into my current spiritual partialities and practices.\nThe Los Baños–San Pablo Walk (June 2022) #Here is a map of the first walk I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing tonight.\nI currently live in a town located two hours away from Manila. It is a town called Los Baños, which is Spanish for \u0026ldquo;The Baths.\u0026rdquo; The town\u0026rsquo;s name comes from the many hot springs that have drawn tourists from all over the country since the Spanish occupation. Los Baños is sandwiched by the largest lake in the Philippines, the Laguna de Bay, and one of the most legendary dormant volcanoes in the country, Mount Makiling.\nOn June 9, 2022, a Thursday, I walked more than 22 kilometers (13 miles) from my apartment in Los Baños to San Pablo City, one of the largest and oldest cities in the country. The long walk, signified by the blue track you see on the map, took over 35,000 steps to complete in more than five hours, traversing the Manila South Road and passing by the towns of Bay and Calauan. From Calauan, which was around the geographical midpoint of the walk, the walk suddenly turned into a 10-kilometer hike on a highway with an elevation of 630 feet. I missed this while preparing for the walk, so I was surprised. Had I known, I would\u0026rsquo;ve cut some weight off the six kilograms my backpack was holding. It was about 10:30 in the morning when I started making the unexpected climb. By 11:00, the sun was peaking, my back was aching, and I was soaked in sweat.\nI\u0026rsquo;m beginning with this walk because it was in the middle of it that I was overpowered by a question that began a spiritual journey that changed my life in the coming years. Physically and mentally exhausted as it was nearing noon, I stopped on a clearing along a ridgeline and leaned on a lone tree. As I was leaning, I turned my glance to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mount Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. On the map, Mount Banahaw is that dark green mound located at the lower right side corner.\nHere is a photo I took of the mountain at that moment.\nAs I stared at Mount Banahaw, I felt like it was watching me. It was then and there when the question came to me: “Why am I walking?\u0026quot;\nThat first long walk was very significant because weeks after it, I continued to revisit that question: \u0026ldquo;Why was I walking?\u0026rdquo; It was a question I realized I didn\u0026rsquo;t really put a lot of thought into before the walk. I have walked almost my entire life and have particularly developed an insatiable appetite for walks, years before that long walk, which inevitably led to it. However, I never really questioned my motivations for walking.\nThinking about my motivations for walking naturally pulled me back to my very first walks, and those very first walks were rooted in the religion of my youth: the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses. As a child, I grew up walking with my father along the remote roads of my hometown, wearing a polo shirt, slacks, and leather shoes, carrying a bag filled with pamphlets and magazines, to go house-to-house, knocking on doors and watching my father talk to people about the Bible.\nWhen I went to college, I began embracing the religion as my own and volunteered for a group in my congregation that visited people with hearing impairments. I learned sign language and joined long treks through hills and mountains to find people we could teach about the Bible. The more I poured myself into the faith, the more I walked. This became even truer when I became a full-time minister and an assistant pastor in charge of creating preaching maps. To create those maps, I had to survey the territories. To survey the territories, I had to walk. I was walking because it was an expression of my faith in Jehovah and his organization.\nBut this was ten years ago. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer a Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witness. So, why was I still walking?\nThe physicality and solitariness of the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo opened something within me that unleashed that question. In turn, that question opened something in me that helped me feel less uncomfortable revisiting my religious past and conversing with it, after many years of avoiding doing so. The long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo helped me entertain the idea that perhaps my insatiable desire to walk is a reclamation of something in my religious past. It underscored the possibility that perhaps I was still very spiritual and religious despite not being affiliated with any religious or spiritual group for over a decade.\nHowever, the long walk also brought forth difficult emotions that made me aware that I was still grieving and dealing with the fallout of leaving the religion of my youth. It made me realize I was spiritually sick, and the walking was a symptom of that sickness. It was another walk, however, a shorter one, that made me realize how much I needed guidance and community to get through this spiritual sickness.\nThe Baguio Walk (October 2023) #Here is a photo of Baguio City, the setting of the second walk I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing.\nBaguio City is a city located in the Cordillera mountain range in Northern Philippines. It was formerly an American colonial hill station, where sick soldiers and American colonial government officials recuperated due to its colder temperature.\nIt was here where I studied in college and where I eventually embraced the religion of my childhood. This was where I served as a full-time minister of the JWs from 2008 to 2011, while I was studying, and where I became an assistant pastor from 2010 to 2011. It was also here, however, where I developed symptoms of a major depressive episode in March 2011. The suffering I experienced during that time crushed my faith in the organization, the Bible, and eventually God. In April 2012, I decided not to attend the memorial of Christ\u0026rsquo;s death, which is the only celebration the religion observes, to signify my decision to leave the JWs.\nOf course, I would return several times to Baguio after this. But during all those returns, I purposefully avoided places that reminded me of my previous life. Since I walked around almost the entire city, this was difficult to do.\nOne Sunday in October 2023, while I was visiting my sister\u0026rsquo;s family, who were living in the city, I stumbled upon a walk that unintentionally exposed me to spaces and encounters that triggered difficult memories and emotions.\nHere is a map of that walk.\nThat morning, I set out to find a well-reviewed Middle Eastern restaurant. After locating it on the map, I decided to walk toward it because Baguio City is very walkable. From my sister’s house in Engineer’s Hill, which is at the lower right corner of the map, I made my way up to Magsaysay Avenue. There, I found the restaurant. However, the food I was hoping to try wouldn’t be ready until about an hour or so, so I decided to continue walking. I headed toward Bell Church, a Chinese Buddhist temple near the border of Baguio and La Trinidad that blends Buddhism with elements of Filipino indigenous religion.\nOn the way, I passed by another restaurant that stirred memories about some fun times I had with previous JW friends. Later, at an intersection, as I paused to let cars pass by, a woman in the backseat of one looked me in the eye as the car went by. I knew the woman. We had been close in my old congregation. She was one of the many friends at the congregation I chose to leave without saying goodbye. Suddenly, memories of those brief but full three years in Baguio came rushing back. Because of this, the walk and the visit as a whole turned out to be unexpectedly emotional.\nMy little walk in Baguio convinced me that to truly reclaim my spirituality without hurting myself any further, I needed to ask for help. I can no longer do it alone.\nSo, tt was at this time that I decided to reach out to a UK-based minister named Andrew James Brown, whose blog I discovered a year before while searching the internet for information about Henry Bugbee. Henry Bugbee was a philosopher who walked. But unlike other philosophers, he wrote very little. His magnum opus, The Inward Morning, was a collection of his philosophical and religious journal entries. I encountered him in 2022 after the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, as I was seriously considering rebuilding religious texture into my life. While Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s work was important, he isn\u0026rsquo;t as discussed as other philosophers, and there were very few writings online about his work. One of these writings was an essay by Andrew in his blog.\nHere is a screenshot of that essay.\nNaturally, after reading the article, I read the About section of Andrew\u0026rsquo;s blog. There, I learned that he is the minister of a small, liberal, free-religious community in Cambridge, UK. I continued reading Andrew\u0026rsquo;s articles, many of which were also sermons he delivered at his church. I resonated a lot with his writings because, like him, I too was a non-theist, and yet I\u0026rsquo;m beginning to see very clearly that I was still very spiritual.\nAround this time, Andrew was already writing about this Japanese religious idea called jiyū shūkyō, articulated and proposed by a Japanese theologian named Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka who lived from 1881–1988. While often translated as \u0026ldquo;free-religion\u0026rdquo; (with a dash), Andrew believes that a more accurate translation of jiyū shūkyō is \u0026ldquo;a creative, free, inquiring, and liberative religion or spirituality.\u0026rdquo;\nI was reading a lot of things at this time, but Andrew was the only religious minister I felt comfortable reading. However, I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel any need to reach out to him until that difficult walk at Baguio, when I felt I definitely needed help. So I went to his blog and filled up his contact form. I told him briefly about my religious past and that he was the only religious minister I\u0026rsquo;ve read for a long time. I was honest, telling him I\u0026rsquo;m opening myself to the possibility of being religious again, and yet I\u0026rsquo;m finding the process difficult and painful.\nAndrew responded with a brief but welcoming reply. He thanked me for reaching out to him and invited me to continue to keep in touch if I have any questions. I indulged and responded with my first question. I asked how one might begin in this open, free religious path or jiyū shūkyō that he has been writing about in his blog. This led to numerous email exchanges and a couple of Zoom calls.\nOne of the things Andrew shared with me was critical when beginning a jiyū shūkyō practice was the importance of maintaining an open heart and an open mind, both on what is happening within me and what is happening around me. With this, he suggested the importance of meditation, which I\u0026rsquo;m already very familiar with as I\u0026rsquo;ve maintained a Zen meditation practice for almost eight years now. Andrew, however, introduced me to a form of sitting meditation devoid of doctrines, sacred texts, and lineage. The practice, called seiza, employed a meditation method that combined the traditional Japanese sitting form of the same name with a breathing technique that emphasized out-breaths over in-breaths.\nAndrew referred me to a Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist minister named Miki Nakura who conducts weekly free seiza sessions via Zoom. For a year, beginning in late 2023, I attended his Saturday sessions and met other seiza practitioners from around the globe as I slowly transitioned from a Zen to a seiza practice.\nRecently, just this June, Miki visited the Philippines, so I got to finally meet him and practice with him in person. Here is a photo I took of Miki conducting a seiza session during his recent visit here in the Philippines.\nAndrew also invited me to join a weekly Zoom meeting he was starting to test interest in jiyū shūkyō. He called the meeting Kiitsu Kyōkai, which literally means, \u0026ldquo;Returning-to-One Fellowship or Gathering.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is also the name of two groups Imaoka Shinichiro was associated with, one of which was the community he started after World War II, where he also explored jiyū shūkyō with a spiritual community. I attended my first kiitsu kyōkai meeting on February 8, 2024. The Kiitsu Kyōkai format was simple. It followed what Imaoka did for his group. We begin with a seiza practice that lasts at most 20 minutes, followed by a short prompt shared by any volunteer from the group, then another short piece of music. All of these were followed by about an hour of free conversation.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been with the group now for about a year and a half, and I\u0026rsquo;ve made real friendships with the people in the meetings. The Kiitsu Kyōkai community also helped me cautiously re-encounter my religious past to look for gems that I could re-integrate into the new religious life I\u0026rsquo;m building. Through the community\u0026rsquo;s help, I\u0026rsquo;ve started using religious words that I\u0026rsquo;ve purposely avoided using since leaving the JWs. For example, I\u0026rsquo;m now using the word \u0026ldquo;faith\u0026rdquo; once more, not to refer to a strong conviction or belief in something but to signify taking the next step and acting despite not knowing the entire picture. For a walker, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t just make complete sense. I also find it very beautiful.\nAfter more than a decade of wandering in spiritual wilderness, I could now say with a clean heart—and I don\u0026rsquo;t take this lightly because it took a very, very long time for me to get here—that in Kiitsu Kyōkai, I\u0026rsquo;ve found a spiritual community I can call my own.\nbOibm (January 2025) #In retrospect, one of the biggest things that attracted me to jiyū shūkyō was its minimalism. Why was this important to me? Remember that leaving the JWs has made me into a spiritual wanderer. Leaving something the way I did not only made it difficult or impossible to return, it also made it difficult for me to trust religions or spiritual groups that resembled that which I left—that is, communities with highly complex doctrines and hierarchical structures. If there is any real chance for me to express my spirituality and be part of a religious community of any sort, that platform has to be as minimal as possible, at least while I\u0026rsquo;m still discovering who I am as a free-religious person. In walking language, give me a portable spirituality, something that I could carry inside my backpack as I continue my wandering, something that could continue to sustain me as I figure more about how I want to proceed.\nJiyū shūkyō has given me this minimal, portable sustenance in the form of Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s principles of living, which he has repeatedly revised throughout his life to articulate the center of gravity of what he calls jiyū shūkyō.\nHere is a simplified version of Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s Principles of Living, which he shared during a TV interview in 1974. This draft translation is by Andrew James Brown.\n1. I place trust/have faith in myself. 2. I place trust/have faith in my neighbour. 3. I place trust/have faith in a cooperative society. 4. I place trust/have faith in the unity of self, neighbour, and cooperative society. 5. I place trust/have faith in the oneness of life and nature. 6. I place trust/have faith in the church. 7. I place trust/have faith in specific religions. 8. I place trust/have faith in free-religion.\nIn Kiitsu Kyōkai, we are constantly encouraged to come up with different ways we can apply these principles in our daily lives. Since some of us delve into the arts, we\u0026rsquo;ve also used these principles to prompt specific creative projects, which were also forms of religious expressions. For example, one of my friends in the community, Celia, uses the principles to think of new sculptures and interpret old ones she did in the past. For example, she returned to her first wood carving about the story of Jacob wrestling with the angel and used jiyū shūkyō to come up with new interpretations of her own work.\nThis photo shows just the first of four panels that Celia carved. All four panels are topped by the image of Jacob wrestling with the angel to find his name. Using a jiyū shūkyō lens, Celia reinterprets this image as a representation of our struggle to affirm ourselves, matching the first principle in Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s Principles of Living: \u0026ldquo;I place trust/have faith in myself.\u0026rdquo; Under the carving of Jacob and the angel is an image of Rachel and Joseph. According to Celia, the image represents Jacob\u0026rsquo;s capacity for love, which reminds us of Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s second principle of living.\nAs a writer and photographer who walks, I\u0026rsquo;ve begun to look closer at how I might be able to use walking as a way to express and further explore jiyū shūkyō. I constantly ask myself, how can I treat walking as a form of meditation or a ritual to sanctify both the time I spend walking and the space I tread on as I walk? These thoughts led to several spiritual walking experiments I\u0026rsquo;ve done in the past two years. One of these experiments was a week-long walk of Los Baños I did last January, and this is the last walk I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing with you today.\nI called the walk bOibm or \u0026ldquo;but Overall is beyond me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe name comes from a beautiful walking poem called Corsons Inlet by A. R. Ammons. In that walk, I plotted six routes around Mt. Makiling, which I covered each morning of the week, less one day in the middle for rest. The routes led to the last silent places in Los Baños, a town that is at the foot of a mountain but is rapidly urbanizing. I started around 8 in the morning and ended before noon. I held several intentions that guided me during each walk. For example, I intended to come to each walk as open as possible, with no expectation or theory to interpret what I see or experience on each walk. I also intended to focus on images, but only take photos when I\u0026rsquo;m truly called. I allowed words to come and wrote them on my phone if they did come, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t force them. As I completed each walk, I contemplated on Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s fifth principle: \u0026ldquo;I place trust/have faith in the oneness of life and nature.\u0026rdquo; After I come home from each walk, I take a rest, then begin culling the photographs I took, choosing about ten or fewer photos. I then edited these and juxtaposed them with the little words that came to me during the walk. The final output was a short missive of photos and text, which I sent to a few friends who opted to receive it via email.\nTo show you an example of the missives I sent, here is what I sent on Day 7, the last day of the walk. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it to all of you to read the missive in silence.\n(To read that missive, click here.)\nAs I get deeper into walking as a contemplative jiyū shūkyō practice, I grow into a deeper appreciation for its openness as a platform of religious expression. However, one of the things I really love about walking is that it is also a great metaphor for the religious life, and it could represent both the beautiful and the messy parts of our religious and spiritual journeys.\nWalking involves leaving, which in my case represents my decision to leave the JWs. Walking could also involve wandering and getting lost, which in my case represents more than a decade of spiritual wandering, going to one group after the other but failing to find one to settle down. But walking also dramatizes the act of getting there and of arrival, which aptly represents my encounter with jiyū shūkyō and the Kiitsu Kyōkai community where I\u0026rsquo;m currently exploring my spirituality. But I think what makes it a great metaphor is that walking maybe repeated. In other words, it could be a practice, a vocation, a path. As Ammons said in Corsons Inlet, \u0026ldquo;tomorrow, a new walk is a new walk.\u0026rdquo;\nTomorrow, our partialities could change, our ideas and the things we put our trust in could be easily shattered and replaced. And so like a walking practice that is repeated and kept, perhaps a free religious life is not necessarily about finding a place to settle in but finding comfort in the life of a perpetual wanderer—a wanderer who is continuously renewed and remade by movement, a wanderer constantly becoming, traversing an open spiritual expanse and perhaps even finding a home there, en route to nowhere.\n","date":"30 June 2025","permalink":"/essays/encountering-a-creative-free-spirituality-jiyu-shukyo-through-walking/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Encountering a Creative, Free Spirituality (Jiyū Shūkyō 自由宗教) through Walking"},{"content":"Often long-form (sometimes, experimental) written artifacts on various subjects.

This is still Vince Imbat and you are receiving this because long ago (or recently?) you subscribed to The Long Walk, an occasional newsletter on walking, literature, photography, and spirituality.\nLast June 28, 2025, while the Pride March was happening at Quezon City here in the Philippines, I was invited by the Global Network of Rainbow Catholics (GNRC) through its Contemplative Spiritual Formation committee to give a talk. Argel Tuason, a new friend and collaborator whom I met just this month, extended the invitation and asked me to talk about jiyū shūkyō, the foundation of the spirituality and religious life I\u0026rsquo;m building.

I\u0026rsquo;ve also published the talk\u0026rsquo;s video and transcript as an essay in my website.\nOne of the thirteen people who attended the talk via Zoom told me during the free conversation that followed that my journey could be a template for a lot of spiritual journeys even among people from the LGBTQ+ community in his tradition. I felt very privileged to hear this. While I use he/him pronouns, I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt fellow-feeling with people in the LGBTQ+ community, so much so that several of my closest collaborators and friends are active members there.\nThe first time I talked about my story in front of a crowd of strangers was in a writers workshop, where one of the panelists, Jhoanna Lynn Cruz, is one of if not the leading lesbian writer in the Philippines. Reading her book Abi Nako, which talked about her journey toward authenticity, coming out from her marriage and relocating from Baguio City to Davao City to begin a new life, spoke strongly to my desire to become my truest self and to be brave in speaking my truth.\nAnd so to be given a chance to talk about my journey in front of the GNRC is a huge privilege, one that I hope to continue doing in the years ahead.\n","date":"30 June 2025","permalink":"/tlw/043/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Talk: Encountering a Creative, Free Spirituality (Jiyū Shūkyō 自由宗教) through Walking"},{"content":" ","date":"29 May 2025","permalink":"/test/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Test"},{"content":" ","date":"17 May 2025","permalink":"/tlw/042/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Walking Bangkok III: Dependent Origination"},{"content":" Yesterday, I was trying to understand why the f-stop number indicated on the digital viewfinder of my camera increases when the aperture shrinks in size. The aperture is the hole in a camera lens that lets light in. The larger this hole, the more light enters my camera. The size of the aperture could be adjusted with a physical dial. Its size is indicated by a number called the f-stop. A low f-stop number, say f/4.5, means a wider aperture, while a bigger f-stop number, say f/10, means a narrower aperture. I later learned that the f-stop number, while not exactly its measurement, increases when the size of the diaphragm of my camera\u0026rsquo;s lens also increases. The diaphragm is a set of overlapping blades that look like leaves that come closer together to shut the aperture and move away from each other to open it.\nAfter writing the piece that follows, I thought about the semantics of closing, shutting, and coming in, and remember how much of the same words apply to my relationship with photography. To be able to let the light in, to truly open myself up to the wide variety of images waiting to permeate themselves into my being, I have to increase the size of my inner aperture by shedding my leaves of insecurity, self-distrust, and pain that may have accumulated for years.\nLet me tell you a secret: I am the most amateur of all amateur photographers. And yet, I\u0026rsquo;ve owned this label, this identity, this appendage to the bio. I don\u0026rsquo;t say, \u0026ldquo;Hey, I\u0026rsquo;m a writer who walks.\u0026rdquo; I say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a writer and photographer who walks.\u0026rdquo; How did I arrive at this audacity? I don\u0026rsquo;t know. Who taught me to do this? No one. As soon as I felt an inner urge to study how I could shoot better images with my camera, it just made natural sense to call myself this—a photographer—in a way that didn\u0026rsquo;t happen to me with other ways of expressing myself, including writing.\nWith writing, I had to fool myself first. I started by writing three things I was grateful for in a small journal for five minutes every morning. After doing this for a few weeks, it became quite apparent that the practice was too limited, so I extended it into a thirty-minute free writing session. This journaling practice became a platform for writing drafts of blog articles and newsletters by hand, which later became building blocks for essays sent to workshops, essays recognized by tastemakers, a zine, and so on. It was only around the time when I established a daily journaling habit that I felt comfortable calling myself \u0026ldquo;a writer.\u0026rdquo;\nPhotography—at least the way I experienced it—was more welcoming. I felt it was okay to take refuge under the identity of being a photographer, even if I don\u0026rsquo;t go out and take a photo every day (I still don\u0026rsquo;t). During times when I can\u0026rsquo;t write a single word on the blank page or just don\u0026rsquo;t know what else to say, I find myself looking for the silence and modesty of photography. I like to think of it not as a complement to but an extension of my writing. Through photography, it is impossible for me to stop writing. Photography, after all, is writing with light.\nDespite the audacity of taking shelter under the label of photographer, I have more proof of my dilettante status than I care to admit. For one, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really care about photos until I started blogging in 2014. But even then, I mostly relied on stock photos to accompany my essays. It was only around 2016, when I got my first smartphone—an Android phone with a decent camera—did I began accumulating photos. But I took photos like everyone else. I point, shoot, and repeat, not caring about composition, exposure, or color.\nAbout a year after this, my Android phone broke down due to seawater damage while island hopping in Palawan. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything about backing up, so none of those photos from that year were saved. I got the iPhone 7 Plus as a replacement and immediately noticed the difference in image quality and experience. The 7 Plus was the first iPhone model to have a portrait mode, so I experimented a lot with taking portraits of people and animals. I took it with me during my afternoon bike rides and also shot some of the landscape of rural Pangasinan. I was far from being good, but I was learning to identify what subjects I liked to photograph.\nA portrait photo of my dog Chikako, just a few weeks after she was born in 2017, taken using the portrait mode of the iPhone 7 Plus. I was elated. Not only was I cultivating a photographic taste of sorts, but I was also producing my own images for my blog. I no longer relied on stock photos. However, I still largely took photos within the context of maintaining a blog. In my mind, photography wasn\u0026rsquo;t yet a thing of its own.\nThis changed in 2021 when I started taking walking more seriously and was exposed to the work of Craig Mod. Suddenly, I found someone whose approach to photography moves me. Like Craig, photography for me was simple. I didn\u0026rsquo;t treat it as a complex fine art. It was simply a way to record moments. Sometimes, those recordings turn out beautiful. To raise my chances of recording beautiful moments, I started taking photography more seriously and calling myself a photographer.\nBut even then, I was still doing mobile photography. The first photography course I bought was an iPhone photography course, which helped me take the most advantage of the iPhone 11 Pro Max\u0026rsquo;s native camera, the only camera I had at the time. I learned how to use the Lightroom mobile app\u0026rsquo;s camera so I could take photos in RAW, then learned how to use presets to edit and improve the quality of my photos. Equipped with this meagre training, I went on my first multi-day walk in 2022, a walk from Los Baños, Laguna, where I\u0026rsquo;m based, to San Pablo City. I took a lot of photos during that walk, all of them using the iPhone 11 Pro Max. It was during that walk that I came face-to-face with the possibility of returning to my troubled religious past as a way to embrace a still very religious present. That walk turned into an essay that landed me a spot in a writers workshop, which solidified further my commitment to writing, photography, and walking as my trifecta for navigating spiritual grief.\nA photo of Mt. Banahaw\u0026rsquo;s peak from the steep Calauan–San Pablo Road, taken during my first multi-day walk in 2022, using the Lightroom mobile app camera in the iPhone 11 Pro Max. It was only after that long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo in 2022 did I finally hit the trigger and bought my first DSLR, the Canon EOS M50 Mark II, which is the only camera I use until now. But I was so intimidated by the thought of shooting photos through that camera that it stayed for almost a year inside my cabinet. What made me take the leap from mobile to DSLR and helped me build confidence in using the Mark II was a book called Read This If You Want to Take Great Photos by Henry Carroll. That book convinced me that I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to know everything that there is to know about the DSLR or photography in general. All I needed to learn was the basics of photography and a minimum viable knowledge of how to use my camera, which the book so eloquently provided in simple language. Equipped with this good enough knowledge, I could then focus on mastering composition, which developed my photographic taste and sharpened my eye. It felt good to have someone say this to me (even if it was just in book form). After almost a year of being locked up in my cabinet, I was excited to finally test drive the Mark II. I brought it with me on a trip to Bohol in September 2023 and took photos in aperture priority (AV) mode. I made a lot of mistakes (really dumb mistakes) during that trip, but I knew I needed to take the leap if I wanted to begin a relationship with my DSLR.\nScene at Panglao Beach, Bohol, Philippines in 2023, shot with Canon EOS M50 Mark II Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve used the Mark II in all my photographic projects, including:\nRoots ྾ Gravel Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1 Walking Binondo but Overall is beyond me I also brought it with me as I photographed the walks I did in Bangkok and Ayutthaya in Thailand.\nIf any, what all of these show is that I still don\u0026rsquo;t know what I\u0026rsquo;m doing most of the time. I just happen to know enough to take some decent photos while on the walk. But quiz me about the difference between the field of view and depth of field, and I might answer you with silence. In addition, my editing skills are still almost non-existent. I still rely a lot on a limited set of presets I copied from other photographers, coupled with a few techniques. Other than that, I really don\u0026rsquo;t do much after taking photos. I rarely touch the colors of my photos when editing. I could produce decent photographs and depend a lot on taking a great photo, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do much editing, but I admit I could do a much better job in this area.\nDespite all these proofs of inexperience, I\u0026rsquo;m quite confident I was able to develop what I think is the most important quality of any photographer—love of the craft. I found that love of the craft is enough to help me sharpen my eye. The technical know-how of photography does very little in sharpening my eye, being mindful of what is in front of me, and expressing myself through a kind of silence I only find in light. In fact, the technical know-how of photography could sometimes even be an obstacle to truly seeing that thing in front of me because it is so easy to get lost in a tool and forget that the tool is an extension of my humanity, not the other way around.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong. I am moving and working toward mastering the technical side of photography because it is what my love of the craft is pointing me to. My love of the craft inevitably wants to go deep, and the technical side of photography is part of that depth to explore. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t overstate that the healthiest and most democratic way to approach photography is to never feel or make others feel insufficient around a camera. We have to remove all the inner hurdles we may associate with photography because this readies our eyes to see what\u0026rsquo;s truly out there, which is also often a reflection of what is in here.\nI have the same philosophy about writing. The more I prune my insecurities around it, the more I strip it off the toxic competition inherent in our traditional education of what writing is, the more affection I\u0026rsquo;m able to feel for it. I sincerely feel that love for a craft, whatever it is, is the only true prerequisite to committing to its mastery, because it is love that will make us stick to it when the practice becomes difficult or the community surrounding the practice becomes unsupportive.\nA mindful photography and holistic biography workshop #I\u0026rsquo;m happy to share that from June to July 2025, I\u0026rsquo;ll be supporting Louise Far as she conducts a photography workshop that aims to help photographers build confidence in their innate ability to see and take photos by applying mindfulness and self-reflection practices from the field of holistic biography work.\nI met Louise in 2023, a few months before I started using my DSLR. Louise is way, way ahead of me in photography, a person with whom the label of amateur may no longer apply. Her portfolio is a testament to that. However, being around her and talking with her about photography as well as doing photographic exercises with her feels like doing so with a supportive friend who comes along with no other agenda other than being with you as you take the shot. Knowing her and seeing how she approaches photography as a spiritual practice has helped me develop more confidence in this craft despite my still limited knowledge.\nWhenever I ask her for advice regarding what tool or lens to purchase or about anything on the technical side of photography, Louise always approaches my questions as questions of the heart. I once asked her whether I should buy a telephoto lens to accompany me on my walks so I could photograph subjects from afar. She reminded me that the impulse to buy a zoom lens could sometimes come from the fear of coming near someone or something. I always remember her words whenever I\u0026rsquo;m photographing on a walk. I remind myself that the purpose of my walk is to be closer to others, both human and non-human. Therefore, it makes sense that closeness should also be a guiding principle in how I approach photography. To this day, I\u0026rsquo;m yet to buy a more powerful zoom lens and always opt to come closer to my subjects whenever possible.\nA photo of my left hand taken during Louise Far\u0026rsquo;s Mindful March workshop in 2023, using the Canon EOS M50 Mark II. Louise will share bits of wisdom like this and many more in the workshop called The Creative Selfie, which will span four weeks. During those weeks, Louise will be sending weekly assignments, which will then be processed during the three five-hour live sessions via Zoom that complete the workshop. I\u0026rsquo;ll be in all of those sessions, managing the technical side of the calls as well as providing my own insights and feedback on the assignments and exercises.\nIf you are someone like me who takes refuge in photography and finds comfort in calling yourself a photographer (no matter how much you kid yourself by saying your knowledge is insufficient) and if anything I mentioned here resonates with you, I invite you to click this link to learn more about the workshop and sign up to join us if you feel called to.\nI would love to take photos with you (and celebrate your images together) no matter what device you use, how much you know about photography, and how much you think you need to learn to be \u0026ldquo;good enough.\u0026rdquo;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a new definition of the word photographer I want to propose:\nphotographer: (n.) someone who takes photos regardless of knowledge, device, and self-belief.\n","date":"11 May 2025","permalink":"/tlw/041/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Let the Light In: Notes on Photography and Self-trust"},{"content":"Umán is a Pangasinan word that means to change, repair, or repeat.

And so, an art practice treated as a religious discipline is my direction. While I shall attempt to create a sincere and honest account of my life, my writing always ought to recognize or even put at the center my relationship to the whole. The way of writing and all decisions related to this (how my work sounds, looks, feels) will always contend with structures that put me in constant conversation with the whole. What literary traditions and forms should I explore and use in my works? How can my choice of form reflect my spiritual, philosophical stance? I want the process of writing, creativity, and sharing the artifact of my creativity to be a way for me to truly be near others. I want to get closer to the natural world, society, people, and the universe during the act of writing. I want to think about my reader when I write. Writing and the network of activities surrounding it are my religion.\nI think a healthy religious position is one where I recognize the differences among cultures and the uniqueness of individuals, but despite that, I trust in an underlying unity that could make communication, peace, and love possible. When the first is lost, religion becomes a tool for oppression, where a dominant culture or belief system is imposed on others and many people. When the second is lost, religion reinforces division and accelerates forgetting—forgetting that before anything else, we are humans and citizens of nature, we were thrown in the Universe outside of our volition, and that we all decay and die, and that these and more unites us—again, outside of our control.\nBut for me, I really want to go deep into writing words that are a balm to others. And there is so much I need to learn to do this. So much I need to do to hear myself. Given that writing is inward, how can it be truly a force of love and cohesion, and growth in mutuality? How can I be religious as a writer, binding myself to others, to a way of life that maintains my interconnection with others?\nTranscendence: (n.) to feel deeply motivated to be a force for others.\nHow do I orient my life based on the understanding that there is something beyond me? Sometimes (and more often than I sometimes care to admit), I find it helpful to personify such an idea. I do feel such a need, and I continue to think that an appropriate, poetic, supreme fiction, when knowingly understood as fictive, but nevertheless wilfully believed in or contemplated, can usefully help me.\nOf all reinterpretations of God, I think Wieman\u0026rsquo;s, which somehow is also related to Dewey\u0026rsquo;s, is the closest to what I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to do with my life—ART. The primary motivation for art is the growth of meaning—a practice that could replace traditional religious discipline today. Since my religion needs an object of devotion, I could call—as Wieman did—this endless possibility of growth in meaning and mutuality as, in fact, God. The primary motivation for participating in the world of culture in the first place is this: to make the world larger.\nIt just dawned on me that the Wiemans\u0026rsquo; theology and my articulation of the world where I walk work together. Here it goes.\nGiven my realization of my thrownness, I could either kill myself or respond to this in pain OR befriend the universe. IT IS A CHOICE. Choosing to befriend the universe is a jump to meaning and its growth. One just fills one\u0026rsquo;s life with pathos until one dies. And then, this pursuit of meaning and pathos could be seen and designed as a religious discipline of imaginative contemplation. Imaginative contemplation, because it is only through the development of our poetic faculties that we can imagine possibilities that will spur us to change. And we need this in our act of befriending this universe because inevitably, befriending will lead us to others, both human and non-human. None of the artists that came before us had to make what they made, and they made them in times when terrible things also occurred. And, many years later, we turn to them to remember ourselves.\nEvery execution of my creative practice is an act of devotion. No matter how seemingly personal or individual this is, it really is orienting my life toward that source of eternal meaning. And this largeness and growth achieved by an art practice could also be used to grow mutuality and love among people. This is how I need to see writing and art—a conscious act of befriending the universe, of entering the world of meaning, a settling, and then walking out of my comfort zone to transcend myself and connect with others in a continuous process of back and forth until re-imagination spurs change. The Unmoved Mover, housed at the center of the Universe, is an indoor God who is going nowhere. But the Creator God walks in the garden in the cool of the day precisely because no Universe and no building contain it. My God is the walk and what can be learned on the walk—that which brings people together, that which expands the world ever-so-slightly more, making us feel so ever-so-slightly smaller within it all.\nIf ever I arrive at the idea of God I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable with, which as it currently is I\u0026rsquo;m felling I\u0026rsquo;m arriving into it if I\u0026rsquo;ve not yet arrived, then it makes a lot of sense to put this central into my life—in a way (even as I\u0026rsquo;m writing this now), I\u0026rsquo;m feeling that I\u0026rsquo;m embodying my religion. If God is Nature and the process that makes it what it is (natura naturans), then a natural religion is one that aligns one\u0026rsquo;s life with this process. I can never lose a genuine religion. Once it is genuine, I can never lose it. Because it is me, it is a way of life, it changes as I change, never ends and never arrives.\nBut we don\u0026rsquo;t always act based on reason. We don\u0026rsquo;t always deliberate. It is the moment and our unspoken relationship to it—our feelings about it—that make us decisive. A compromise: an agreement that aligning myself to the whole and its growth might be the supreme value. But my daily choices won\u0026rsquo;t always necessarily reflect this, given the constraint of the moment (the here and now). And that is why religiosity is intentional and requires hard work. But also surrender. Sometimes, I just have to surrender to what the moment asks and trust that the supreme thing will eventually prevail.\nThis image of the window at Sta. Maria and the image of this window here at LB. And the shadow of the trees. And I talking to that God, perhaps the closest thing ever.

There is an innate fear of being lost, especially when one is alone. Then, there is the fear that the fear of being lost would devour what pleasantness is left of the trip.\nBut when we started walking along Sukhumvit, the street immediately sucked me in. A spiraling into images that are new yet familiar. \u0026ldquo;This could\u0026rsquo;ve been the Philippines,\u0026rdquo; I caught myself saying.\nThe glass wall of a store hangs a large neon green logo: a cannabis leaf. Outside its door, a sign: \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t Panic\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s a safe space! Every Saturday Hiphop o\u0026rsquo; Clock Party Starts at 10 PM.\u0026rdquo; In my country, a store like this along EDSA would\u0026rsquo;ve made us all forget 2016.\nLike EDSA, Sukhumvit is almost always busy. But unlike EDSA, there are almost no one blasting their horn. The roads in Thailand, I would later learn, kill more than anything in this country. My last night in Bangkok, before I went to Ayutthaya, my friend made me ride the motorcycle. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a different experience!\u0026rdquo; she said. To her credit, it was! One I will never go through again. Like Filipino riders, Thais like to make their bikes fly. But unlike Filipino riders, they don\u0026rsquo;t give their passengers helmets. I swear it was by miracle that I was alive after that night.\nAt Rhama IV Road, the pedestrian lights just turned green. I was fortunate to reach the center island before the vehicles came. A white man tried to do what he would usually do where he came from\u0026ndash;walk. A large truck blasted its horn (the first time I heard someone do so since I got here). The white man, startled, pointed his palm at the light, visibly frustrated. But there\u0026rsquo;s nothing he can do. In Thailand, the roads follow a sort of natural selection. The larger vehicles devour the little ones. The little ones devour the pedestrian. In the Philippines, I could look at the driver in the eye, and he would almost always stop. If not, he would get an earful from me. But here, I whimper like a stray dog. Bangkok is walkable except in its pedestrian lanes. Thank God for their wide sidewalks and lengthy skywalks. This could\u0026rsquo;ve been the Philippines.\nAt the Jim Thompson Museum, the house and estate left by this rich American textile enthusiast who walked into the mountains of Malaysia never to return, the tour guide was catching her breath. She seems to be trying to get the tour over with. But in the guest room, she slowed her pace to ask a question. \u0026ldquo;Which among the objects in this room is the chamber pot?\u0026rdquo;\nI saw how the tail of this cat figurine curled on its back to land on its neck, making some sort of a handle, and I immediately knew there was something funny about it. So I pointed it out to the guide. She nodded and began to describe that the tail was, in fact, the handle, and the head the cover. A boy guest could remove the head and stick his penis in the cat\u0026rsquo;s body to pee. The guide went on to say that Jim Thompson insisted that the figurine was just for display, and his guests never used it. \u0026ldquo;But one would wonder,\u0026rdquo; the tour guide said, \u0026ldquo;why there are yellow marks around the cat\u0026rsquo;s neck.\u0026rdquo;\nIn the morning of my second day in Bangkok, I decided to walk the streets of Phra Khanong by myself. At the mouth of Soi Sukhumvit 48, an older lady was selling pan cakes. Thai pan cakes, says the translation of her signboard. I went to her and said good morning, but this didn\u0026rsquo;t register. I pointed at one of her signboards, which shows a box of cakes and 20 baht under it. She seemed to have understood. She packed a set of cakes, placed them in a paper box, wrapped the box with plastic, and handed it over to me. In return, I gave her my 20 baht. I started munching the cakes as I walked toward Sukhumvit and up the overpass to the other side of the road. Wow, this is probably one of the best things I\u0026rsquo;ve ever tasted.\nIt was past 10 in the morning. I looked down from the overpass and saw the vehicles passing by Sukhumvit. There is enough road for everyone. A garbage truck passes by, its pile of black bags momentarily blocking my view. On the other lane, a bus stops to drop passengers. On the overpass, a beggar was sitting under the sun\u0026ndash;the first I\u0026rsquo;ve seen since I arrived. When walking on the overpasses of Manila, the world\u0026rsquo;s capital of homelessness, I would often see four, maybe five homeless people sleeping, resting, or begging. I remember them as I left some coins on his pan.\nFrom here, I saw an old building. Residential. Home to around twenty or so families. Its facade is stained, made old and tired by all the keeping up it\u0026rsquo;s been doing. One won\u0026rsquo;t see the building unless from this vantage point. Bangkok does a good job of hiding the ruins of industry. I walked down the overpass and saw a Buddhist nun in purple garb standing with a brass bowl hanging on her neck through a purple cloth bag. Begging, too, but under the shade of a store selling some glassware. With no more coins, I dropped a bill in her bowl and bowed with my palms together.\nThis morning, this is what I do.\nI continued walking and entered the small road toward the wet market.\nOn the walk, a poem:\nThe soul of the city is in this wet market. The conscience of its people, red spicy and aromatic wrapped inside plastic bags, set on the table where old men and women line up to grab what they need, exchanging pleasantries, exchanging baht. Sometimes a young boy hangs them on the handles of his bicycle.\nThe heart of the city beats in its little daughters, two of them walking ever trustfully as they watch some reels on their phones. Another plays house over vacant steel tables, acting like a mother berating her two daughters. This city\u0026rsquo;s life force flows in the veins of billiard tables. Old men begin their day here with beers.\nThe spirit of this city descends in the shape of a pigeon strutting unabashedly beside my feet. Sometimes it shape shifts into the form of an almost silent motorcycle, whizzing an inch away from my belly, startling the hell out of me. But the soul of this city is barely breathing. I could see its ribs move on the rotting facade of closed shops, hear it wheezing from behind their walls. Whatever\u0026rsquo;s left of this city, whatever cigarette butts, lie underneath this man\u0026rsquo;s table. He crawls under it, grabs the dark slime that has clogged his sewer, and throws it on the concrete.\nThis city knows how to hide its scars, they\u0026rsquo;re barely seen. But the light is always honest, always true. At this intersection where light plays house with silence, a child, one with long black hair, emerged out of nowhere and walked in between this city\u0026rsquo;s shadows. I dropped a bill inside the brass bowl of a Buddhist nun in purple garb, only to return later to take her photograph.\nAt an intersection before the BTS station, a street shrine stands in front of a donut shop. Motorcycle riders park in front of it while waiting for their next ride. A woman in red, carrying a white tote bag, crosses the pedestrian lane next to the shrine safely. A man with a hat moves in the opposite direction. Nearby, mothers hold the arms of their daughters as they walk past vendors of snacks: sandwiches, salads, bread, and water. One vendor sells flowers, perhaps for the shrine. A few yards from the station, a lady fervently prays in front of a large statue of Ganesh. Some steps away, in front of Taisin Square, another street shrine. As if none of that was enough, at Ekkamai, where I ended the walk, I stopped by Wat That Thong to look at the Buddha in various poses.\nIn Bangkok, the street is the shrine; the walker inescapably a pilgrim.\n","date":"27 April 2025","permalink":"/tlw/040/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Walking Bangkok II: Pilgrimages"},{"content":" I said good morning as I opened the door. He gave me nothing but silence. I was afraid to offend him in any way, so I kept my mouth shut for the entire 30-minute ride.\nIf not for the orange light of the city, it would be totally dark outside. From inside the car, I see a fog crawling, slowly thickening, stricken by orange. In many areas we passed by, there were almost no vehicles. At this hour, the metropolis tries to sleep.\nAt my destination, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure where I should stop, so I patted him on his shoulder and asked him to drop me off at what looked like an empty community café. I asked him whether I\u0026rsquo;d already paid by card when I booked the ride, or if I should pay him in cash. I heard his voice, finally, one of the meekest I\u0026rsquo;ve heard in a long time. He said, \u0026ldquo;By card.\u0026rdquo; I misunderstood how he pronounced the end of that word. Card and cash in his Thai almost sounded the same. He noticed my confusion, so he showed it on his phone. \u0026ldquo;Card,\u0026rdquo; he repeated. I nodded and smiled and thanked him as I got out of his car. Almost instantly, I regretted that I didn\u0026rsquo;t try to lure him into a conversation a while ago.\nThere was a large bench outside the community café. From afar, it looked like it was made of rattan, but really it was all plastic. I walked toward it, heaved my bag onto it, and sat down. I pulled my phone from my pocket and began typing a message to my friend.\n\u0026ldquo;Not sure where to go. So went here to what looks like a café. Will wait for you until you wake up.\u0026rdquo;\nAs soon as the light on my phone vanished, I heard some whistling up in the trees. These trees have grown as tall as the third floor of the building beside them. I saw cars on each floor\u0026mdash;parking for the middle-class living in this condominium at a less fancy part of Bangkok.\nThe whistle continued briefly, a sharp staccato. I counted six or seven segments in that thread. After a short pause, I heard another whistle, which I\u0026rsquo;m sure was coming from a different part of the tree. This whistle was longer, slower, still segmented, but struck a lower note. Again, a brief pause before another whistle from a farther place I\u0026rsquo;m no longer sure of. I felt like it was no longer coming from the tree. This went on and on, and the whistles were luring me to sleep. I looked at my phone again. It was now 3:00 in the morning.\nAt one point, I stood up to check the vending machine to see whether I might be able to buy a drink. The whistles, of course, continued in the background. I walked toward a large white refrigerator. There were the familiar sodas. There was cold coffee and what I was sure was Thai milk tea. I\u0026rsquo;m not a vending machine person. In fact, the Philippines isn\u0026rsquo;t a vending machine country. The mayor of my town placed machines like these all around town after assuming office. The one nearest my house was at a waiting shed in front of an elementary school. I\u0026rsquo;ve always doubted whether people bought into that machine. I know for a fact that we would rather buy at sari-sari stores where we could talk to the person handling us the goods we need. A part of me wants to believe we resist all these new technologies because we still desire that ease we associate with interacting with a body and a talking head. But this is just me dreaming.\nI brought this Filipino fear with me as I stared at the machine. All its labels were in Thai, and all I\u0026rsquo;m sure of is that it could accept coins. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure, really. All I had were bills, and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure where to put them. So I gave up and walked back to the bench. I walked back to the whistles, which were everything one could hear at this hour. I sat and closed my eyes, and I listened closer. I remembered the silence inside that taxi a while ago.\nWhen my friend arrived, we started walking to the unit. I shared about the whistles, told how good they sounded, and told how they almost succeeded in serenading me to sleep. My friend said the birds actually whistled to mark their territory, warn others of their boundaries. Hearing this was enough to make me silent for a while.\nI could still hear them\u0026mdash;all those whistles\u0026mdash;as I stood inside the glass wall in my room. I\u0026rsquo;ve turned off the light, covered myself with the thick blanket as if to protect myself from the now heavy fog that has already enveloped the entire city. It was still very dark, but the flyover visible from my window is now beginning to fill up. I closed the curtains and lay down my silence beside me, allowing it to fill the room. Suddenly, the whistles were gone.\n","date":"23 April 2025","permalink":"/tlw/039/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Walking Bangkok I: Whistles"},{"content":"In the middle of January, my partner and I traveled to Tagaytay for a three-day retreat. During that retreat, I was able to look back at 2024, celebrate its highlights, and write a few intentions for 2025. This reflection led me to publish my 2024 annual review, the eleventh since I started my website in 2014. In that retreat, it became clear to me that my most important goal for 2025 is to write a manuscript for the book about walking Los Baños, which has been in my mind since 2023 and which, until today, has never really found a concrete form. The progress I\u0026rsquo;ve made in integrating my religious past with the creative, inquiring, free, and liberative spirituality I\u0026rsquo;m exploring at the present helped me make more sense of the direction of this project, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve never been more prepared and confident to take it on. The reason why the project never took off in 2023 was because I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready.\nTo move toward the direction of writing a manuscript, I knew I had to perform a second week-long walk of Los Baños. The photos and realizations that would come from this rewalk, I hoped, would add to the existing materials for the manuscript. I\u0026rsquo;m glad to report that that rewalk, which I called but Overall is beyond me has happened from January 25 to 31, and its archives can now be accessed here. The rewalk made me realize that slower and shorter walks with a pilgrimage nature work better for my taste and the general trajectory of the book project. Slower and shorter walks are quieter, easier to perform and document, and focus more on the experience rather than the narrative that comes out of the walk. While I still think the anthropological nature of my first weeklong walk of Los Baños ( Roots x Gravel) is important and useful for my book project, having an alternative walking experience of the same place helps. I now have two walk experiences to compare to each other that would help me write the book better and design future walks. In the middle of bOibm, I hopped on a two-hour call with a friend who generously offered her expertise in biography and photography work to conduct a full review of my 33 years of life (I\u0026rsquo;m turning 33 on February 9!). We\u0026rsquo;re hoping that this project could help me better write the book, among other possible benefits. This project will take a significant part of my February, and I\u0026rsquo;m very excited to start.\nIn other writing-related news, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to separate my website from my talahardin (garden of notes). My main website is still at vinceimbat.com. However, my talahardin is now located at a subdomain talahardin.vinceimbat.com. A main motivation for the decision is to have more freedom in the general design and feel of my website, one that isn\u0026rsquo;t easily achieved using Quartz, the software that I use to host my public notes.\nStill writing-related, my friend and UPLB professor Ivan Labayne, whose book Beckoning Baguio was one of the most important books I read last year, has very kindly included my and Jesa Suganob\u0026rsquo;s zine so we must meet apart in the required reading materials of his new course offering \u0026ldquo;Uncreative Writing.\u0026rdquo; Another friend, Amanda Dela Cruz, who teaches creative writing at the Ateneo de Manila University, has also added my hybrid poetry collection and essay Mapa ng Los Baños Patungo Sa\u0026rsquo;yo to the course materials of a creative nonfiction (CNF) subject she\u0026rsquo;s teaching. The reason I\u0026rsquo;m sharing this is that as a writer who often works solitarily on my walks and my desks, it isn\u0026rsquo;t always clear how my words could find practical use in the real world or someone else\u0026rsquo;s life. To know that they will be read by students, at least for this semester, is something worth celebrating. Both of Amanda and Ivan\u0026rsquo;s courses delve into critical and alternative approaches to literature—a subject and process that has helped me tremendously in and complements my nonconventional spiritual point of view. So to have my works included in attempts to encourage more conversation in this discourse is something I\u0026rsquo;m very excited about.\nI end this issue of Uman with a pitch. My friend Andrew James Brown is leading one of the inaugural events offered by the newly started Free Religion Institute of the International Association for Religious Freedom (IARF). The first session, which he facilitated on January 29, 2025, and which I was fortunate to attend, delved into the life and ideas of Imaoka Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō (1881-1988), an important Japanese religious thinker that I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned several times in this website. Imaoka articulated tentative statements about what he called jiyū shūkyō, a creative, inquiring, free, and liberative spirituality, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been exploring in my walks, photography, and writing. The second session, which will delve into Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s ideas on holding spaces for people who resonate with and are interested in practicing jiyū shūkyō, will be held on February 26, 2025, via Zoom. If any of these interests you, please check this page for the time, Zoom links, and other related information.\n","date":"2 February 2025","permalink":"/uman/024/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 024 — January 2025"},{"content":"Dear friends,\nbut Overall is beyond me (bOibm) is done.\nThis is a short email I\u0026rsquo;m writing to wrap up the project before I delete this email list.\nThank you #First, I want to thank all of you who joined me, through this still intimate online space we call email, while I walked all six walks I did from January 25 to 31, 2025. It was the first time I invited readers to sign up on a separate temporary email list (what the Japan-based walker and writer Craig Mod calls a \u0026ldquo;pop-up newsletter\u0026rdquo;) to follow the walk. My main intention for doing so is to avoid sending daily emails to people who would rather not receive them. I\u0026rsquo;m very much aware of the amount of email clutter people receive, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to add more to these. However, I also realized that doing this makes my walk truly more rewarding as I know from the get-go that I\u0026rsquo;m only sending the missive to individuals who truly care about the project. Many other readers did follow along through social media, but those of you who read my emails have a special place in my heart. You were enough to motivate me to process, prepare, and send those emails every day after the walks (despite the fatigue).\nFor those of you who signed up late and who didn\u0026rsquo;t receive the earlier emails, I\u0026rsquo;m happy to say that all the daily missives I sent during bOibm are now uploaded to my website and can be accessed on this link. I encourage you to visit the link and look at any issue you missed.\nThe Routes #Also, some of you might wonder where exactly did the walks happen. In case, at an unforeseen time in the future, any of you would like to follow the walks yourself, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing the routes here. These are the last silent spaces in Los Baños, a rapidly industrializing suburb in between the legendary Mt. Makiling and the largest lake in the Philippines, Laguna de Bay.\nDay 1: Aranas route to Flat Rocks\nThe Aranas water intake is an old structure that supplied water coming from Mt. Makiling to the upper areas of the University of the Philippines Los Baños during the 1920s. The trail is marked by really old and broken concrete water pipes. However, the trail was recently destroyed by the deluge of storms that devasted Southern Luzon during the last quarter of 2024. Because of this, I was lost during the walk and was forced to return without reaching Flat Rocks. Day 2: \u0026ldquo;Nasa Labas ang Ili\u0026rdquo; (NLAI) route\nThis is the route where I brought two groups of walkers back in 2023 for a walking meditation on self, kapwa, and place. I decided to rewalk to the route as it still is one of the best routes in Los Baños. The walk combines walking on a sidewalk of the university, a community of informal settlers, footpaths between farm lots, and a vacant concrete road dedicated to walkers and bikers. It also features one of the best views of Mt. Makiling. Day 3: Batis route\nThis route leads one to a closed road that lies alongside a creek of the Molawin River, the main tributary of Laguna de Bay. The old name of the road was Caimito (Star Apple) but is now named after Jose Drilon Jr. Friends who discovered this route call it Batis (spring). It is one of the most accessible routes to the Molawin River, where locals also do their fishing when the water is high. The road has been closed since before the pandemic, but the university has invested in improving it in recent years, leading us to think it might open up for vehicles soon. Day 4: Rest day\nDay 5: Makiling Botanic Gardens\nThe route around the Makiling Botanic Gardens (MBG) gives one a taste of what hiking Mt. Makiling might entail. While the majority of the route features \u0026ldquo;artificial\u0026rdquo; forests curated by the management, about a third is a natural forest that visitors seldom enter. I walked under those trees there for the first time in my four years in LB and I would say it is one of the best walks I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. There were lots of trees, lots of terrain to hike, and lots of birds singing. A huge portion of that walk consisted of one of the longest stretches of silence I\u0026rsquo;ve ever listened to in a long time. Day 6: Freedom Park\nWhile not the most silent of places, I still think Freedom Park is one the most accessible places for people to connect to themselves, their neighbors, and nature in Los Baños. When one is fortunate enough to walk here during the early morning when students haven\u0026rsquo;t yet arrived or during vacation days when there are very few around campus, one can hear the place\u0026rsquo;s full honesty. About half of Freedom Park served as a prison camp for Americans and Europeans captured by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Thousands died from hunger on its grounds. Later, when the remaining prisoners were liberated by American forces, the Japanese killed hundreds of Filipino locals of Los Baños in response. I\u0026rsquo;m always mindful of this history whenever I walk here. Day 7: Mariang Makiling Trail (MMT)\nOn the last day of the week-long walk, I walked four stations of the MMT under some heavy rain and strong wind. I felt the need to stop the walk after coming on a large tree that tumbled down in the middle of the road due to a landslide that may have happened during one of the strong typhoons that came into the area last year. The MMT leads to two peaks of Mt. Makiling, a hike that would require about eight hours (climbing and returning) by foot. Like the other mountains in Southern Luzon, Mt. Makiling\u0026rsquo;s terrain has given birth to tens (hundreds?) of stories that syncretize ancient Tagalog anitism with Catholic and European beliefs. While I\u0026rsquo;m closing this project, I\u0026rsquo;ll still be writing a few of my reflections about the process of doing this walk on an upcoming issue of Uman. Now that a second walk of Los Baños has been done, I also feel ever more confident to begin a long-postponed work of writing a book about walking here. As I see it now, the book ought to braid two narratives: (1) a narrative of befriending a place (Los Baños) through walking and (2) a narrative of conversion into a creative, inquiring, free, and liberative spirituality or jiyū shūkyō. To write these two narratives, I will have to return to earlier journal entries, do some research, and piece my findings together. I\u0026rsquo;ll also be working with a friend who practices both mindful photography and biography work to help me write these narratives as honestly as I can through text and photos. All of these will be enough to keep me busy this February.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all from me for now.\nAgain, thank you for walking with me during bOibm, and I hope to walk with you again in the next months or so.\nAcknowledgments #The name of this walk \u0026ldquo;but Overall is beyond me\u0026rdquo; as well as the titles of each missive come from the poem Corsons Inlet by A.

What is the better attitude here? Rather than doubt, perhaps, stay with it. Perhaps the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; feeling or action will emerge later. Perhaps, in this walk, allow myself to be excited and be out of the need to be as present as I could if that is what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling at the moment. Then, when I catch myself suddenly awakening out of that surge of passion, I\u0026rsquo;ll take it as a reminder to return to the present and just be. When I feel another surge of passion, perhaps, I\u0026rsquo;ll let it hold of myself once more. And the cycle goes on.\nOn this walk there was a long period of passionate looking—not searching for images but responding to a lot of new ones. And then a realization that I was no longer present in the walk so I have to call myself back to it. And then a getting lost and having to be in survival mode. Then an acceptance of defeat that I have to return. A sense of relief that I\u0026rsquo;m back on the path. And then a return to listening to the birds.\nBut no cameras now.\nA long branch broken\nfell on the path\nsomething to hold on\n","date":"25 January 2025","permalink":"/boibm/001/","section":"but Overall is beyond me (bOibm)","summary":"","title":"[bOibm] Day 1 — the sudden loss of all routes"},{"content":" there are dunes of motion,\norganizations of grass, white sandy paths of\nremembrance\nin the overall wandering of mirroring mind:\nbut Overall is beyond me: is the sum of these events\n— A. R. Ammons, Corsons Inlet\nFriends, I\u0026rsquo;m walking again—rewalking Los Baños (LB), where I currently live, to be exact. It\u0026rsquo;s a walk I must\u0026rsquo;ve done last year, but last year had other plans for me. And so before the coming of what could only be (yet again) a scorching dry season (around April to June) and a torrential wet season (around June to December), I must walk.\nThis is a very late notice, as I plan to do the walks beginning tomorrow, January 25, until the end of the month. This walk must be done now or it will never happen this year.\nAs I did before, I\u0026rsquo;ll send daily missives about the walk for those who want to receive them. To avoid overcrowding your email inbox, I\u0026rsquo;ll only send them to you if you really want them. If you really want them, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to sign up your email on a separate list by clicking this link. I\u0026rsquo;ll delete that link after the walk.\nBut haven\u0026rsquo;t I walked LB before? Yes. I did a week-long walk of LB last December 4–11, 2023, which I called Roots ྾ Gravel (R྾G). This new walk was supposed to be an exact repeat of that walk, a return to the six routes I visited. But a lot has happened around me and within me since that walk, and while it would be nice to return to those routes, this is not what is calling me now.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing instead in this new walk I\u0026rsquo;m calling but Overall is beyond me or bOibm (after an excerpt from the poem above), is to return to some familiar places here in LB and immerse—really immerse in them as slowly as I can. The walks, therefore, would be shorter and slower than the R྾G walk.\nThe R྾G walk featured six routes that totaled 72 kilometers (44 miles) in length and covered almost all major walkable areas around LB (87 streets in 13 out of 14 barangays). My goal then was breadth—to see as much of the town as I could, to see the difference between communities in the hillier parts of town and the communities along Laguna de Bay, and to get a pulse on the speed of industrial development in this rapidly developing suburban municipality located in between the legendary Mt. Makiling and the largest lake in the Philippines. My intention with R྾G was to know the place through quick strokes of my feet.\nI produced more than a thousand photos and sixteen thousand words during that week. I began the walks in the early morning, finished before noon, and went straight to writing and editing photographs in the afternoon. I sent missives to subscribers almost before midnight. The project required a significant measure of physical endurance.\nWith bOibm, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to let go of all those for now and approach the week-long walk with a gentler, more attentive pace. My reason for doing this is to explore the possibility of a real relationship with some of the last silent places in LB. The routes and places I chose for this walk demand a gentler, more attentive, and slower pace, and I handpicked them for this project to remind me of this very intention. Why do I need to explore this new form of relationship? I guess for two reasons: fear and necessity.\nFear because in my four years living here, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen how spaces have rapidly changed. A new multistory dormitory is being built in my neighborhood, which is one of the quietest. It will be built this year and the street won\u0026rsquo;t feel the same. I just know. The same is happening in almost all major streets in LB. If I don\u0026rsquo;t walk them now, get to know them better, there could be very little chance to do so in the coming years.\nNecessity because, like you, I\u0026rsquo;m vulnerable to the unpredictable disappointments and blows innate in human life. I assume that once a true relationship with the last silent places in LB is established, they could serve as places of quick retreat, a thing that is also rapidly becoming a form of privilege these days, left to be enjoyed only by those who have the material means to do a quick excursion out of urban and rapidly developing suburban places.\nBut privilege is not what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for in my walks but pilgrimage. One that is inward first (and, therefore, always cheap and accessible) but also a pilgrimage to that often overlooked Other that makes up the Overall that is beyond me—the non-human world of rocks, soil, water, clouds, plants, trees, animals, and even the objects that pollute them. While human encounters and narratives were at the heart of R྾G, bOibm would focus on silent encounters. Because of this, I\u0026rsquo;m expecting that the missives I\u0026rsquo;ll be sending during the walk will primarily contain photos. Words, if any, would be limited. Whatever words come my way during these walks that I\u0026rsquo;m moved to share, I\u0026rsquo;ll do so in their rawest form. This would ensure that I\u0026rsquo;m handling this new walk with as light a touch as possible.\nBeyond what I\u0026rsquo;ve written here, I really don\u0026rsquo;t have a comprehensive theory on why and how I want to do this walk. Like I\u0026rsquo;ve said in previous essays: walking is just being who I\u0026rsquo;ve always been.\nI hope you consider joining me on this week-long rewalk of LB, and if there\u0026rsquo;s anyone you know who might enjoy receiving these emails, please forward them this email or send them the signup link.\nThank you!\n","date":"24 January 2025","permalink":"/tlw/038/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"New Walk: but Overall is beyond me (bOibm)"},{"content":" Yesterday, the sun began to show when we started walking out of the lobby. The strong wind was still there. The cold, too. But the rain has stopped, and light has started to get through the thick clouds hovering fast above us.\nNot far from where we walked was Mt. Taal, lying perfectly still after a couple of reported minor eruptions, the latest of which happened the night before we came. It was invisible from where we walked. But a couple of days ago, the clouds let us see it as we took a sip from our cacao drinks.\nWe rented a room for three days. There, we put ourselves into a retreat, hoping to look back at 2024 as closely as we possibly could. This looking closer, we assumed, would tell us what worked in the past year and what we could step on as we enter this new year. While we were looking, we also tried to peek into what this new year has been showing us in its first two weeks, hoping to know what narratives to let go of and what intentions to set.\nIn this short essay, I hope to share some of the insights that came from that retreat, specifically the highlights of my 2024 and the things I learned from them.\nTall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1 #Last January 15 to 21, 2024, I went to Baguio City to rewalk some of the routes I used to walk on as a former minister of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. You can read all of my missives from that walk here.\nIn an essay introducing the project, I wrote my purpose for doing the walk:\nThe decision to revisit these places and, dare I say, “re-own” them is not a rushed decision. It started about two years ago when I began making peace with my past. These days, I continue to ask myself what really happened back then and what I can learn from that seldom-visited time in my life that could enrich my present existence and the path I’m treading. For someone who has tried so hard to forget about certain places and specific periods of his life, to say that this project and everything it represents is necessary for me to continue living is an understatement.\nOne of the things that surprised me while doing the project was that while I grappled with difficult emotions, what I was most concerned and curious about was the fate of my friends in the congregation I associated with in Baguio. Suddenly, I felt a desire to see them even for just once to know where they’ve been, who among them are still alive, and somehow hope we would all still get along well despite how different we’ve become. This realization strengthened my resolve to meet my neighbors on my walks no matter how different they are from me.\nWhere the Sun Warms #A few weeks after the Baguio walk, I started working on an essay that applied Nietzsche’s prognosis for existential illness in making sense of my desire to rewalk the ministerial routes I used to go to as a JW. What I learned from this process was that years after I left my childhood religion, I’m still healing from all of it and to finish my healing process, I need to honestly recognize elements of that past life that still work for me and incorporate their new interpretations into my present life.\nYou can read that essay here.\nKiitsu Kyōkai #Kiitsu Kyōkai (帰一教會), which literally means “Unity Fellowship” or “Gathering,” is the name of a small group that started congregating via Zoom in February 2024. Among its main aims is to explore and expand the ideas of the Japanese educator and interfaith pioneer Imaoka Shin’ichirō (1881–1988) summed by the term jiyū shūkyō, which can be translated as a “creative, inquiring, free, and liberating religion or spirituality.”\nI have joined these Kiitsu Kyōkai meetings (or KK as I now call them) since the British minister Andrew James Brown invited me. Throughout 2024, they gave me a regular space to explore how I might practice my own customized spirituality in the context of a supportive community. Now, almost a year after I started attending the meetings (and I’ll elaborate on this further in an essay I’m writing about KK), I find myself compelled to call Kiitsu Kyōkai my spiritual community—a statement I don’t take lightly because it has been more than a decade since I last felt truly welcome, safe, and most importantly, authentic, in a spiritual community.\nReviewing my past writings during the retreat, I was surprised to discover that I felt a strong resonance with KK right after the second meeting I attended. I remember leaving that meeting feeling encouraged and motivated, which reminded me of similar feelings I had in the past when I attended religious gatherings as a youth.\nMapa ng Los Baños Patungo Sa\u0026rsquo;yo (A Map of Los Baños to You) #This is the title of the (draft) poetry collection I sent to the Katipunan journal of the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) last late 2023 for possible publication in their upcoming Buhian literary issue. The Buhian issue was looking for literary works written in Filipino that used hybrid forms—forms that challenged or crossed the boundaries of existing traditional genres.\nI discovered in 2023 that my writing thrives best in a hybrid form that combines techniques and styles from creative nonfiction, research writing, and poetry. What I sent for Buhian was a collection of drafts of some of my poems written while living here in Los Baños. These drafts are publicly accessible through a digital archive I call talahardin. Using QR codes, I emplaced the poems on specific coordinate points on a partial map of Los Baños.\nIn the collection’s accompanying essay entitled “Ang Borador Bilang Panitikan ng Paglalakad” (The Draft as Literature of Walking), I explained how my experience of walking lends itself to producing drafts and draft-like materials that can then be captured and maintained through my talahardin. As I talked about walking, I also wrote a quick history of walking in the Philippines and presented a brief overview of the country’s existing walking literature. Since the essay is itself hybrid, I shared a bit about my personal history of walking, how it is connected with my complex religious past (mentioning jiyū shūkyō briefly in a footnote!), and how this spurred walking projects while living in Los Baños. To date, this is my first biggest publication and the first time my story of getting out of my childhood religion and exploring a freer, more creative form of spirituality has been shared in a national publication.\nMy contribution was accepted and the Buhian issue has been published since November 2024, and so my (draft) poetry collection and its accompanying essay can now be accessed online using this link. The work is currently in Filipino, but since I own the copyright of the entire piece, I’m planning on translating it soon and making it more accessible to non-Filipino-speaking readers.\nA Sunday Walk #Another essay I am proud of writing in 2024 is called \u0026ldquo;A Sunday Walk.\u0026rdquo; It is an essay that talks about a practice my partner and I started doing in May 2024. It involved going out on a walk, writing together using a prompt that we prepared, and then sharing what we wrote with each other. We did the practice every Sunday, providing a spiritual practice that we could both do together. As soon as I shared the essay, many of my readers and friends reached out to tell me how they resonated with it. Some of these people are also exploring freer ways of practicing their religious life, but some, I was surprised, were churchgoers. Writing and sharing this essay reaffirmed my intuition that many people a thirsty for a creative, inquiring, free, and liberating religion or spirituality, and this people sometimes include individuals who practice their spirituality in organized institutions.\nBathala Wala #About the same time I wrote the essay about our Sunday walks, I started feeling an itch to begin dipping my toes back into the waters of a religious subject that I’d avoided for too long. The itch may have been triggered by my conversations with my partner, who expressed her need to gain some measure of clarity on where she stands on the issue of metaphysical teachings she inherited from her childhood religion, teachings such as the existence of hell.\nI tried so hard to avoid exploring my past metaphysical beliefs, feeling like these were less important than the work of finding and maintaining spiritual practices that felt right. My conversations with my partner, however, made me realize that metaphysical subjects can be very helpful to many people. One metaphysical subject that I know I could benefit from getting some measure of clarity on to arrive at a current position is the issue of God. In an essay I called \u0026ldquo;Bathala Wala,\u0026rdquo; literally “Bathala None,” a play on the Filipino expression “Bathala nawa,” which means “May Bathala will it to happen,” I introduced a project to use walking to confront the issue of God’s existence. I’m sad to have to park this project in place of others I did in 2024. But it is definitely a project I want to return to in 2025.\nWalking Studies #One of the intentions I set in 2024 was to deepen my understanding of the walking methodology in literature. I was partially successful in doing so. I got through around half of Vincenz Serrano’s syllabus for the course of walking he teaches at ADMU. Brought by these readings and my reflections on the subject, I published two things that I hope would help fellow Filipinos experimenting with walking:\nA talahardin page on walking - This page in my talahardin holds links to my own works and thinking about the subject as well as links to existing literature from other Filipino authors. How to walk the Philippines - Another page in my talahardin, which contains a rough draft of my initial thoughts on some guidelines on how to walk the Philippines given its unique historical, social, and geographical context. so we must meet apart #Another project I was excited to finally release in 2024 was my first zine and collaboration with Cagayan de Oro writer Jesa Suganob. This was a project we started last 2023. Inspired by Gabrielle Bates and Jennifer S. Cheng’s collaborative work of the same name, so we must meet apart was an experimental project that delved into the poetics of walking and writing from the perspective of different genders. The zine is a collection of epistolary essays Jesa and I wrote to each other after walks we did in our respective locales. The letters crawled into diverse subjects—body, gender, religion, mental health, grief, poetry—and bordered into confessions. We released limited print copies at the Better Living Through Xeroxography (BLTX) event at Sikat Studio, Tomas Morato, Quezon City, last August 3, 2024. Readers who were kind enough to tell us their thoughts about it said the work was beautiful and that it kept them company during travels and some difficult days. Since this was my first zine, I had too many insecurities about releasing it, most I was afraid to admit even to Jesa. Hearing all those positive feedback helped me go through releasing the work and letting it go.\nWhile print copies are sold out, you can still purchase a digital copy via Gumroad.\nContributions to Pangasinan literature #After publishing my poem Gawat and its translation Tagsalat at TLDTD and encountering writers writing in my mother tongue who found it, I’ve since faced the dilemma of how much commitment I should give to writing in Pangasinan. I was primarily a writer in English, who somehow could also write in Filipino. To add another language to the mix seemed like too much work. While I doubted the measure of commitment I could give to it, I never lost my desire to contribute to Pangasinan literature, which has seen a scarcity of works produced since the half of the twentieth century.\nMy commitment to exploring my mother tongue gained a boost after learning about the death of Santiago Villafania, Pangasinan’s most important contemporary writer. In a time dubbed by some as Pangasinan literature’s Period of Silence, Villafania made his voice known and put Pangasinan literature not just on the nation’s map but also on the international literary scene. He died at a relatively early age, leaving the state of Pangasinan literature even more uncertain. While disheartening, his death also solidified the resolve of other Pangasinan writers to continue what he started.\nIn June 2024, at the Palihang Rogelio Sicat 17, I read my Pangasinan poem Obong (Nest), which received some generous feedback from my co-fellows and panelists. At the culmination of the workshop, several of my co-fellows and I presented a reading of the poem in five Filipino languages. The reading can be watched here and is still one of the best experiences I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had in 2024.\nAbout a month after this, I met my Pangasinan writing colleagues for the very first time in the panel discussion “Pangasinan, Literature, and Nation” held at Urdaneta, Pangasinan. Attending that event and talking to my colleagues further inspired me to deepen my commitment to supporting the Pangasinan writing community’s initiatives. Through video clips taken of that event, several important issues concerning Pangasinan literature were finally brought to light in front of the public, where they received the attention and discussion they deserved.\nAttending my first BLTX event also helped me put the plight of Pangasinan literature in a better perspective. Seeing how small-scale publishing could hasten literary production, I thought about using it to spur self-publication of works written in the language, something I tried to articulate in a post called Muli-muliy Panself-publish ed Pangasinan (Some Thoughts on Self-publishing in Pangasinan).\nAt the end of 2024, two other opportunities helped me solidify not only my commitment to contributing to Pangasinan literature but also my desire to use this avenue to explore my most important project: developing my own creative, inquiring, free, and liberating spirituality. The essay I sent as an entry to the Gawad Bienvenido Lumbera 2024, a nationwide contest that aims to recognize literary works written in several of the Philippines’ regional languages, was entitled “Ikurit Ko’y Sali-salik ëd Sayan Dalin: Pitoran Akar” (I Will Write My Feet on This Land: Seven Walks), included a narrative about how I grew up walking with my parents to preach about the Bible from house to house. Meanwhile, my poetry collection “Bëltangën Tayo’y Këlpa” (Cut Through This Fog), my entry for the first Gawad F. Sionil Jose, explored my complicated relationship with my father before and after I left the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Both works won in each contest and would soon be published in print.\nIt is nearly evening as I’m wrapping up this annual review article, and I’m here standing at my desk in my room at Los Baños. The sky, which has been gray most of the day, is now turning darker, while the air feels the same. Not far from where I’m standing, I hear someone pounding a hammer on what could only be a piece of wood.\nI will always feel grateful for 2024, both for its challenges and rewards. But my eyes are already hovering above visions of the following days, weeks, and months when I return to projects I’ve parked and begin new ones, endeavors that I hope will bring deeper meaning to what almost always feels like fleeting time.\nThis sentence, then, is the brake, the much-needed pause, the only true anchor to everything real. And while I’m here on this pause, I want to look you in the eye, for longer than usual, and tell you how grateful I am for your time and silent companionship. I hope you stay around this 2025.\n","date":"15 January 2025","permalink":"/essays/2024-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"2024 Annual Review"},{"content":"1.1\n[[ivan labanye|Ivan Labayne]], [[beckoning baguio labanye|Beckoning Baguio]]:\nFramed in lazy opposites, Manila would be the 9 p.m. start of the party, well-dressed and ready to take in all stimuli while Baguio would be past midnight, inebriated, dulled and possibly reflective, worn down and possibly more honest.\n1.2\n[[walking beckoning baguio|Walking \u0026ldquo;Beckoning Baguio\u0026rdquo;]]:\nBut the collation of essays into eight sections I take as a reflection of the tempered nature of walking Baguio. Yeah, walking Baguio can still feel scattered, but it mostly feels arranged. Due to the city\u0026rsquo;s smallness, familiarity with spaces becomes easy, and with that familiarity comes indescribable comfort. In other words, walking Baguio doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel as messy as walking Manila. This comparison is important because Baguio and Manila were the first guinea pigs of American-enforced city planning, the goal of which was to paint in the minds of the newly colonized that everything was okay and beautiful. With this historical knowledge, one might say the Americans found more success in Baguio. Beckoning Baguio is a reminder, though, that the city of pines, as pretty as it is, is mired by the same problems recognizable throughout the country\u0026rsquo;s many urban landscapes. If this is a walking book, then it would move the reader to walk and, specifically, to walk Baguio. When the reader ever reaches that point, I think of no better companion than these essays.\n2.1\nSwedish proverb:\n\u0026ldquo;No one becomes a good doctor before he fills a churchyard.\u0026rdquo;\n2.2\nJournal, 6 October 2024:\nRaining outside and natural light is scarcer than usual.

Already, in the hallway, I can smell it, and walking down the hallway and into the living room, the odor is strong: brownies, freshly baked brownies, warm and waiting for us. Such a delight. Such a welcoming, beckoning house to walk into. It says, “welcome”—the brownies do. But of course, if brownies, then a time to eat them, and to chat and laugh and thereby to be at home.\nThere is other food on the table awaiting the mid-evening break: melon, raw carrots, freshly washed grapes, coffee, tea, soda, orange juice and, as I said, chatter and laughter. At the break, we will have been writing together—the ten or twelve of us—for an hour or so, having been invited to respond to some lines from a poem or a book, or to some pictures or to several articles: ancient kitchen utensils, old fashioned toys and children’s books, a line from a song, the song itself. That’s how Pat begins the evening.\n3.2\n[[writing is embodied|Writing is embodied]]:\nCertain positions while [[writing]] produce certain emotional responses. How we move our hands, breathe, seated, or how our body is positioned affects what comes out of our mind.\nThe embodied experience of writing is important to consider when writing alone, but it becomes even more important while writing with others. This is because it is when we decide to write together and share that writing that past traumas we have about writing emerge.\nSo when conducting a workshop, it is important to consider:\nthe place (sights, temperature, sound, wideness, etc.) the body of the writer the rules the prompt 4.1\nThe question of changing the name of I.A.R.F. as viewed by Japan Free Religious Association\nWe have, therefore, always, been a little dissatisfied with the name of I.A.R.F. which has been un-doubtedly Christian-centric. We can, easily understand that such a Christian-centric attitude is quite natural for European Christians who think much of their past history and tradition, because non-Christian liberals in Japan are also much attached to their own history and tradition.\nWe are, therefore, very anxious to have the word “Christianity” dropped from the name of I.A.R.F. If the word “Christianity” remains un-dropped, we shall be obliged to cancel the invitation of the 19th Congress in 1967 to Tokyo (as I announced unofficially in 1961 at Davos Congress) because non-Christian members of Japan Free Religious Association and religious circles at large in Japan will not cooperate.\n4.2\n[[my vision statement|My vision statement]]:\nI have brought to life a creative [[spirituality]]—a way of life—customized to my needs, personality, and strengths. It is a [[jiyu shukyo|free and inquiring spirituality]] that is also anchored to my culture. This creative spirituality informs how I exist in the world—[[my daily routine|my daily practices]], the work that I do, and how I [[action|act]]. While it liberates me, it also strengthens my faith and connection with my kapwa both the human and the non-human. I\u0026rsquo;m part of a [[kiitsu kyokai|community]] of individuals walking on the same path who support me in the realization of my vision.\n5.1\nShin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka:\n“As you read in my Statement of Faith, there is no mention of God. It is a creed without a God. I have faith in self, in other people, in society. There is no God in my creed. However, if one believes that the universe is religion, then if it is necessary to use the word ‘God’, I see no objection. Then man is God, society is God and the universe is God.\nThe founder of Konkokyo, Kawate Bunjiro, pointed out that the kami is dependent on the adherents and the adherents are dependent on the kami. It is understandable how the adherents are dependent on the kami, but it is not clear how the kami is dependent on the adherents unless one realizes that the founder meant that the kami and the adherents are inter-dependent. This can be interpreted as meaning that God depends on the believers, and the believers should be worthy of this regard.”\n5.2\nJournal, 13 October 2024:\nRecently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been introduced to the idea that [[animism]], which describes precolonial Filipino spirituality, could be a resource for [[my jiyu shukyo|my jiyū shūkyō]] project, particularly because of its similarities with [[pantheism]]. [[shintoism|Shinto]] is also animist but has pantheist elements. If there is liberal Shinto then there could be—at least with my personal [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]] project—be a liberal Filipino animism or whatever it is called. In such a progressive remaking of our precolonial spirituality, what I want to emphasize is the pantheistic elements—that nature is divine and that humans are part of that larger nature, intricately connected to it, in fact.\n6.1\n[[henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee]]:\nGet it down. Get down so far as possible the minute inflections of day to day thought. Get down the key ideas as they occur. Don’t worry about what it will add up to.

I treat words that come out of me as valuable gems or seeds—miracles waiting to happen. This is an even deeper poetics than a walking poetics. To see my words and my writing as something that could build up a person in any way.\nThe challenge and calling then in terms of writing is how to keep it this way. How can I ensure that how I approach writing as a practice maintains this reverential treatment of it and how can I give birth to words that are truly a balm for others?\nIn addition, how can I build a writing life inspired by a spiritual quest, practice it happily every day, and at its own best time produce nurturing work for those who listen to me?\n7.1\nAndrew J. Brown:\n[T]he civilised worm is always-already breaking up the soil of a compacted self in a way that doesn’t destroy its integrity as a self, but, instead, is opening it up to allow the inflowing of many new insights and ideas which begins to turn us into what Imaoka-sensei eventually came to call “cosmic human beings” (宇宙人uchūjin), i.e. human beings who are fully aware of the inter- and intra-connectedness of all things.\n7.2\nJournal, 15 October 2024:\nThis [[ikigai]] and the [[self]] behind it is already here.

In making the journey, I have no aims. These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints.\nAndy Matuschak\nAn exhortation. When I find myself lost in tiny details, focused on execution over wondering and big-picture questions, I try to remind myself to get curious. My default mode, having spent so many years as a technologist, is to focus on tasks, on doing, on accomplishing. That’s often necessary to meaningful intellectual creative work, but it’s certainly not sufficient. Too much doing-focus will crowd out the expansive mindset which generates new insights. It’s hard to hear yourself think.\n8.2\n[[my jiyu shukyo|My jiyū shūkyō]]:\nSince creating my jiyū shūkyō will be a long and winding process, it\u0026rsquo;s unwise to treat it like a [[04 notes/project]]. It\u0026rsquo;s best maintained or supervised as a [[life area]]. Success in this endeavor isn\u0026rsquo;t measured by finishing or reaching an end point but by maintaining a certain standard. In this case, my standard for my jiyū shūkyō could be something like a portion of [[my mission statement]]: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m engaged every day in a pursuit of wisdom, meaning, and beauty.\u0026rdquo;\nSpecifically, success in my jiyū shūkyō area includes the following:\nmaintenance of contemplative practices like [[seiza]] and [[04 notes/walking]] maintenance of mindful [[reading]], [[journaling]], and studying through my [[talahardin]] maintenance of practices through communities and others maintenance of creative practices involving walking, [[writing]], and [[photography]] But how do I study in a way that makes me feel that I\u0026rsquo;m not constricted, that I\u0026rsquo;m allowed to flow and follow my curiosities, while maintaining a measure of focus?\nIn the creation of my jiyū shūkyō, I need to let go of this desire for blueprints. Spirituality and answers to how to live are best left unblueprinted. I should have faith that this process will result to something. As long as I follow my curiosities and authenticity, I will eventually focus.\n9.1\n[[isabelo de los reyes|Isabelo de los Reyes]]:\nThe ancient chronicles of Jesuit and Hispanic friars say that upon the arrival of the first Spaniards, the coasts of the Visayas and even in Manila, there were many converts to Mohammedanism, and even more could be found in Mindanao that were converted by the islamic teachers from Borneo. So, if we are to find the true Philippine religion at its purest, we must look to the mountainous regions of the North. Knowing how to distinguish the True Religion from those that were influenced by the Hindu, Mohammedan and Christian grafts can be difficult, but the true Philippine religion is still intact, not only among the Itnegs (Tinguians), but in the legends, advices and superstitions of the Tagalog\u0026rsquo;s, Visayan\u0026rsquo;s, Bicolano\u0026rsquo;s, Kapampangan\u0026rsquo;s, Zambaleno\u0026rsquo;s, Pangasinero\u0026rsquo;s and other Filipino ethnic groups.\n9.2\nJournal, 18 October 2024:\nPrecolonial Filipino spirituality had Hindu and Buddhist influence. There is some proof that our culture was closely influenced by South Asian culture. Ancient Filipino religion must have been syncretic—a mix of [[anitism]], [[hinduism]], [[buddhism]], and some [[islam]], particularly in the south. One could only imagine what our society looked like without the coming of [[christianity|Christianity]]. Maybe we are a country of contemplatives, growing up from homes where we both meditated but also believe in [[bathala|Bathala]] or Laon or Kabunian—perhaps something like Tibetan Buddhism. A mix of animitism and Buddhism would produce something like this. And since none of these ancient religions are colonial, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t destroy each other. All would\u0026rsquo;ve flourished and will have more resources today for creating religions of the future or individual spiritualities.\n10.1\nRaymond Guess:\nSo the experience I have of my everyday work environment is of a conformist, claustrophobic and repressive verbal universe, a penitential domain of reason-mongering in which hyperactivity in detail—the endlessly repeated shouts of \u0026ldquo;why,\u0026rdquo; the rebuttals, calls for \u0026ldquo;evidence,\u0026rdquo; qualifications and quibbles—stands in stark contrast to the immobility and self-referentiality of the structure as a whole. I suffer from recurrent bouts of nausea in the face of this densely woven tissue of \u0026ldquo;arguments,\u0026rdquo; most of which are nothing but blinds for something else altogether, generally something unsavory; and I feel an urgent need to exit from it altogether.\n10.2\nJournal, 31 October 2024:\nIn creative writing, the need to produce something that is understandable is akin to an obsession with ratiocination observable in analytic philosophy.

My gut tells me that anyone who has had the opportunity to call Baguio a home for at least a year will feel the same when reading anything written about Baguio. I was feeling nostalgic reading the first few essays of his book when suddenly, on page 37, Ivan talked about nostalgia:\nThere is a way of reading nostalgia that departs from defeatism. Instead of just being mired in memories of the past, one can take off from such fond recollections in sizing up and seizing the present and future.\nIs not nostalgia a still dominant attitude among long-time Baguio residents, especially those who have lived through the earthquake and the pre-mall Luneta Hill, and why not, even through the Japanese occupation?\nIvan was just a year ahead of me when he came to the University of the Philippines Baguio (UPB) in 2007 I in 2008. And that is why I find his face very familiar. It is a shame, though, that while Ivan was developing his writing voice and the activism that propels it, and still is very much felt in these essays, our paths never coincided in Baguio. From 2008 to 2011, I was deep into my evangelical ministry, while my last three years in Baguio from 2012 to 2014 were spent on interpreting and organizing work with the Deaf community there. I already quit my religion in 2012, but I thought I could still do something for the Deaf community before I left Baguio.\nAs I read Ivan\u0026rsquo;s book, the only thing that I know somehow connects us all those years is the ambulation. The streets that Ivan\u0026rsquo;s feet walked on were the same streets I walked on and knew (and still know as deeply as he does). With a funny turn of cosmic events, our ambulations seem to have brought us to Los Baños, where we both live now and where our meeting is finally ripe for the making. Last September, while I was in the middle of walking the pages of Beckoning Baguio, Ivan and I did our first walk together along the mountain and gem streets of Batong Malake.\nUntil I\u0026rsquo;m proven otherwise, I think it is safe to declare that Ivan Labanye is Baguio\u0026rsquo;s first millennial flaneur and Beckoning Baguio, the first book borne out of walking Baguio in the twenty-first century. I\u0026rsquo;m okay with making such grand claims and celebrating them even if I\u0026rsquo;m proven wrong later because I think it is critical to demarcate time when talking about walking in a place made complex by history like Baguio. Also, with what I think is the most walkable city in the Philippines, I am compelled to express how much I find it surprising not to have come across a book about walking Baguio by a local until now.\nI finished Beckoning Baguio right before September ended after buying it at this year\u0026rsquo;s MIBF and using it as my pampatulog book. I am tempted to conclude that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the beginnings of insomnia that caused my unusually frequent sleepless nights in September, but this book. Ivan cautioned us in the foreword that this book is a collection of his columns from 2018 to 2020, an information I understand was necessary to divulge but one I personally didn\u0026rsquo;t need to know. Read without this foreknowledge, Ivan\u0026rsquo;s 49 essays would\u0026rsquo;ve read like vignettes, a form chosen by some walkers writing prose. The rambling subjects of his writing easily make this a walking book. Reading several essays before hitting the sack felt like taking a quick walk with long strides that made me traverse Harrison, then Session, then Magsaysay.

If this is a walking book, then it would move the reader to walk and, specifically, to walk Baguio. When the reader ever reaches that point, I think of no better companion than these essays.\nWhat I love the most about Ivan\u0026rsquo;s writing is the \u0026ldquo;walkiness\u0026rdquo; of each piece. Unlike a sitting-in-the-park Tiempo-esque reading experience, I had to make frequent and unexpected turns as Ivan cites this book then that before making a comment on a specific spot in the city and, after citing one last book, brings us all to a dead end, a construction site or a vandalized wall at a seldom walked street. The cul-de-sac is, of course, Ivan\u0026rsquo;s signature witty synthesis. I felt this most in the consecutive essays \u0026ldquo;Too Calm for Snow\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Tahimik na Tumatalak.\u0026rdquo;\nDespite the columns being written only in a span of three years, Ivan chose to subtitle his book \u0026ldquo;A Decade of Walking in a City of Pines,\u0026rdquo; and why not? I don\u0026rsquo;t think he could\u0026rsquo;ve written these essays without a decade\u0026rsquo;s worth of intimate knowledge of Baguio gained only through pure love of the streets.\nAs I re-walk the ministry routes I walked in Baguio from 2008 to 2011, a project I call Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1, which I started in January of this year, I would say that Beckoning Baguio has given me a familiar but entirely different perspective of the city I once and still call home, a perspective I\u0026rsquo;m hoping could bear new interpretations and reinterpretations of my walks there.\n","date":"9 October 2024","permalink":"/tlw/037/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Walking \"Beckoning Baguio\""},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m Vince Imbat, and this is Uman, a collage of updates on projects and studies from the previous month I send to dear friends and readers every month. This is its August 2024 edition.\nBLTX #BLTX, short for \u0026ldquo;Better Living Through Xeroxography,\u0026rdquo; is a gathering of zinesters, independent publishers, and small presses, where new and old zines, books, and merchandise are sold directly by writers and artists to readers. The first BLTX was organized a few months after [[adam david]] published his manifesto entitled \u0026ldquo;Better Living Through Xeroxography: Literary Patricide by Way of the Small Independent Press\u0026rdquo; on April 2, 2009. After explaining how the Philippine mainstream publishing industry gatekeeps the emergence of new voices in writing and kills experimentation in new forms of writing lives in the name of profit and preserving the status quo, Adam\u0026rsquo;s call to arms in his manifesto came as follows:\nWhat we should be focussing on is creating and providing new venues for alternative attitudes in Reading and Writing, creating and providing new venues for ourselves and our \u0026ldquo;unmarketable\u0026rdquo; material, for our \u0026ldquo;unrefereed\u0026rdquo; efforts. What we should be focussing on is developing and cultivating an audience that will read and understand and actively seek our work. We should stop writing down to Mainstream Publishers\u0026rsquo; standards of marketability and literariness and start writing up to raising the quality of available reading material, and the only way to do those things and remain untarnished\u0026ndash;remain honest to ourselves and to our art\u0026ndash;is to do the publishing ourselves.\nThe first BLTX expo, conceptualized and organized by The Youth and Beauty Brigade, was held the following year on 3 December 2010 at a videoke bar called Ilyong\u0026rsquo;s at Kalantiaw, Project Four, Quezon City. Since then, BLTX has grown significantly, sparking the creation of small presses and independent publishers. These entities have since co-organized and supported the expo, which is held multiple times a year in different parts of the Philippines.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a latecomer to BLTX (well, to literary life in general). My first exposure to it was from a friend who runs a small independent press. But I never gave much attention to BLTX during those few years I\u0026rsquo;ve known this friend. What got me thinking about BLTX and the principles that gave rise to it was reading Conchitina Cruz\u0026rsquo;s dissertation [[authoring autonomy cruz|\u0026ldquo;Authoring Autonomy: The Politics of Art for Art\u0026rsquo;s Sake in Filipino Poetry in English\u0026rdquo;]], which I read while writing an essay late last year. [[conchitina cruz]], or Chingbee, is Adam\u0026rsquo;s wife. In the last chapter of her dissertation, entitled \u0026ldquo;The Filipino Author as Producer,\u0026rdquo; Cruz explains why she continues to self-publish her works despite working in the academe, where publishing opportunities abound.\nMy employment as a teacher of creative writing in a university converts my work in poetry into salaried work. The pursuit of tenure obligates me to produce poetry along a path apart from Lacaba‘s \u0026ldquo;Kagila-gilalas\u0026rdquo; or Tariman‘s work: the anonymity to which their poetry aspires is the fate my poetry ought to evade. It is in my interest as an academic for writing to become a precious commodity produced by the specialist. In the academy, a branch of the professionalized literary world, my signature is a necessity whose value should increase over time. This trains me to invest my work in pursuits compatible with the industries and institutions whose recognition of my byline invests it with value.\nShe continues\u0026hellip;\nBecause I have, for good or ill, decided to remain a practitioner in the professionalized world of writing, I am perpetually troubled by my complicity in the recognizably unjust mechanisms that govern it. What options for resistance are imaginable for the poet as academic, whose career requires deference to existing structures that poetry itself supposedly, at least symbolically, resists?\nAnd finally\u0026hellip;\nIn other words, I cannot reject the status quo simply by writing poetry. To propose an alternative attitude necessitates an alternative position in relations of production, a distinction which has changed my attitude toward the publication and circulation of my work.\nWhat position did she choose to take?\nI have, however, since then, published books and zines of my work (including There Is No Emergency) independently, through the DIY efforts of local small presses which I help finance and run. These works are neither eligible for awards, whose rules for participation require the resources of bigger publishers, nor visible in National Book Store, whose shelves are reserved for Anvil Publishing and other publishers that can afford its shelf space.\nReading Cruz\u0026rsquo;s thesis and encountering BLTX is one of the many growing-up moments I had as a writer in the last two years I\u0026rsquo;ve intentionally chosen a life in letters. These encounters continue to challenge my own poetics and relationship to the mode of production of my own writing, which heavily leans toward the use of journal entries, drafts, and this website, a digital garden I call [[talahardin]], which is by itself an archive, an unfinished work incapable of being produced through traditional means of mainstream publishing.\nOf course, I went to my first BLTX at Sikat Studio, Tomas Morato, Quezon City, this August. I was compelled to go because I assisted my friends in releasing a zine I co-authored with [[jesa suganob]], a collection of epistolary essays on walking called [[so we must meet apart]]. I was reunited with several friends at the event, including co-fellows from the two national writing workshops I\u0026rsquo;ve attended. I also took home a handful of zines, most of which I consumed throughout August. The best thing that came out of the experience, however, is my realization that the self-publishing model is actually the best model for producing work in the Pangasinan language, where there are very few audiences. As I wrote in my short essay \u0026ldquo;[[muli-muliy panself-publish ed pangasinan]],\u0026rdquo; a small audience necessitates the production of works in small quantities. This model also encourages writers to publish their works because of its relative ease. Since a lack of literary output is a primary reason why Pangasinan literature has been at its low for almost a century, self-publishing through small presses, I think, is the way to go.\nA Walking Poetics #Aside from thoughts on self-publication, BLTX triggered more thinking about my poetics as a writer. I admire the self-reflection of Cruz, David, and the many other writers supporting the movement, and I am encouraged to look at my own position and my own principles of writing.\nThis August, I took some time to revise [[my poetics]], a work-in-progress document that, like most of the things I\u0026rsquo;m writing these days, is currently fragmented and unfinished. But I\u0026rsquo;m sharing it here anyway because this is my poetics: a walking poetics that leans toward the unfinished, the meandering, and the fragmentary.\nWhile thinking about my poetics, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but think about my overall writing life. I bought a date stamp and added this as part of my daily journaling practice. I was surprised how something as little as stamping the date on the page encourages me to write and show up every day on the blank page. I also moved my office to a smaller but quieter room in my apartment and added a whiteboard and a bookshelf. I also bought my very first printer as I intend to read drafts of my works in printed form as part of my revision process, which I\u0026rsquo;ve omitted for years.\nIf much of the writing life is defined by the material circumstances that make literary production possible, then perhaps little tweaks like this in a writer\u0026rsquo;s material environment have some effects. We\u0026rsquo;ll see if I\u0026rsquo;m right in the months ahead.\nPhotography and Psychogeography #After BLTX, I continued studying the walking literature. I\u0026rsquo;m currently going through each reference in [[vincenz serrano|Vincenz Serrano\u0026rsquo;s]] syllabus for his walking class at the Ateneo de Manila University. My reading this month centered on [[theory of the derive debord|Theory of the Derive]] by Guy Debord and [[why observing matters nightingale|Why Observing Matters]] by Virginia Nightingale.\nIt was in the middle of my reading when my friend and mentor [[louise far]] encouraged me to send an application to the 2025 Angkor Photo Workshops to be held in Siem Reap, Cambodia, early next year. I only had a few days before the deadline, so I used what I already had. I sent a collection of photos I took during the [[tall tales 1|Baguio walk]] I did last January 2024, when I revisited several routes I used to walk on as a minister of the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses more than a decade ago. I then attempted to write a proposal.\nI knew if I proposed any photographic project, it would involve walking. My previous walks, however, were text-heavy and not really photographic projects per se. Somehow, as I look back at those walking projects, my intention to produce words got in the way of producing a more cohesive photographic part of the project. My photos were secondary to the text. In short, I\u0026rsquo;ve never really had a photo-first project. How could I design a photo project involving walking in Siem Reap?\nI returned to what I already knew. I returned to my earlier readings on walking and sought to integrate them into my proposal. I decided to propose a psychogeographic walking photo project set in Siem Reap. In simple terms, [[psychogeography 1]] is a field of study that took off after the Second World War at the center of which is an inquiry on how places make us feel and why. The [[derive]], a methodological walk, is the primary tool of psychogeography. Luckily, I found a couple of recent studies that applied psychogeography to photography: [[photographing loneliness wang|Photographing Loneliness]] by Yitong Wang and [[psychogeography and photography arnold|Psychogeography and Photography]] by Emma Arnold. These two readings made me realize how photographers have applied psychogeography in recent years and what sort of projects could be designed by combining these two. I don\u0026rsquo;t expect to get in the workshop. But writing that application helped me return to thinking about my photographic practice, something I have again neglected in recent months, and how it relates to my walking practice.\nA Hundred Different Ways to Walk in Pangasinan #These days, I\u0026rsquo;m working on an essay about walking in Pangasinan, the province where I grew up. I intend to do at least one week-long walk of the province before the year ends, but I want to do it with a clear framework. So, this essay is an attempt to find that framework.\nMy essay revolves around this question: \u0026ldquo;How should I walk Pangasinan?\u0026rdquo;\nTo play with the question, I started listing different walks in the province I\u0026rsquo;ve done in the past and sketched vignettes about each walk. There is a vignette about the first walk I did as a child based on accounts from my parents. There is also a vignette about my very first funeral procession.\nSince I was writing the essay in Pangasinan, I looked for specific words to name the kind of walks my vignettes were trying to encapsulate. I was stuck finding a Pangasinan word for a child\u0026rsquo;s first walk. In English, there\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;toddle.\u0026rdquo; In Filipino, there\u0026rsquo;s ampang. There has to be a word in Pangasinan. I used the [[cosgaya dictionary]], a Pangasinan dictionary written in Spanish and the oldest dictionary available. It is a scanned PDF that is downloadable from the internet. To look for the Pangasinan word for toddle, I decided to search for the occurrence of the Spanish word niño (or child) throughout the dictionary. I looked at each occurrence until I found what I was looking for. There are two Pangasinan words for a child\u0026rsquo;s first walk: ampang or tayakdang.\nFinding these two words gave me an idea: I would look for all the occurrences of the Spanish words caminar and andar, two words used to refer to walking, throughout the Cosgaya Dictionary to find whether there are other forms of walking in the Pangasinan vocabulary. The search, which took two days of my time, revealed over a hundred words describing distinct and specific forms of walking.\nThere are lots of words describing how a drunk walks: dangaldangal, diwetdiwet, dompalit, dungey, dungil, tingaytingay, and waralwaral. Several words also refer to how the sick or old walks: dapilos, kapakapa, patilpatil, kitakit, and kitday. But what I was really amazed about was finding words that refer to very specific kinds of walking—walks that one won\u0026rsquo;t even care to name these days. For example, the Pangasinan language has a word for walking sideways like a crab (damimi), walking with wide steps then stopping as if to bow (indo-indok), and walking together as a group while holding each other\u0026rsquo;s hands (tambing). Why we had all these words about walking in the past and why we no longer use them today is a question I would like to find answers to in the coming months.\nI plan on publishing the essay as my first zine in the Pangasinan language this year or the next.\n","date":"7 September 2024","permalink":"/uman/022/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 022 — August 2024"},{"content":"I asked her whether she would accept our invitation to serve as a panelist in what I thought was the first (now I learned it was the second) creative writing workshop in the Pangasinan language. My colleagues highly recommended her.\nShe declined. She said her handle of the language isn\u0026rsquo;t strong. She writes using how she speaks, using everyday Pangasinan, which seems different from the literary pieces she reads written in the language. She said she may have won the contest because she wrote with her heart. She said, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet have what it takes to be a panelist and would rather be a participant.\nI thanked her for her response and told her I respected her decision. However, I also shared that I felt the same way and that I\u0026rsquo;m a firm advocate of the way of writing she described. I told her that the workshop would be launched in 2025 and that she should feel free to contact me if she ever changed her mind.\nHello reader,\nIn case you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten, this is Uman (or Change), a monthly newsletter on spirituality, walking, writing, and photography. And I\u0026rsquo;m Vince, a Pangasinense writer trying to weave all these together into a life.\nPangasinan, Literature, and Nation #In July, I went home to Pangasinan (again) for about a week to attend the one-day conference \u0026ldquo;Pangasinan, Literature, and Nation\u0026rdquo; organized by Panpacific University, Urdaneta City, in collaboration with PEN Philippines. The conference featured two panel discussions (one in the morning and another in the afternoon) tackling Pangasinan\u0026rsquo;s current state of literature. To provide a summary of what that state looks like, here\u0026rsquo;s an excerpt with a proposal I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on recently:\nWhile the Pangasinan province\u0026rsquo;s more than three million residents represent nearly two-thirds of the total population of Region I and nearly 3 percent of the population of the Philippines, its indigenous language, particularly in its written form, is continuously diminishing in use.\nWhile spoken Pangasinan is enjoying a revitalization through the rise of social media influencers who use the language in their reels, videos, and posts, the production of works in written Pangasinan, particularly literary pieces, has been meager since the 1960s. There is a glaring dearth of written works in the Pangasinan language, which is explained by the lack of writers writing in the language. As Melchor E. Orpilla, the current commissioner of the Pangasinan language in the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino (KWF), alluded to in the July 2024 event \u0026ldquo;Pangasinan, Literature, and Nation\u0026rdquo; held at Urdaneta City, the number of writers in the Pangasinan language can only be counted in both hands. Furthermore, even if there are contemporary writers in the language, there is no assurance that a new-wave literary movement composed of a younger generation of writers would arise.\nTwo years ago, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t part of that number of Pangasinan writers countable only with two hands. But with writers getting old and some dying, I find myself getting closer and closer to the fold.\nDuring the event, I met some of my Pangasinan writing colleagues in person for the first time. They found me online when my poem \u0026ldquo;Gawat\u0026rdquo; was published by TLDTD.org in 2022, and we have connected ever since. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until July 2024 that we saw each other in person. Through several minutes of conversation with them during break sessions in the event, I was inspired to deepen my commitment to supporting the Pangasinan writing community\u0026rsquo;s initiatives. After the event, I shared several video clips on social media, stirring honest public conversations about the state of writing in the language. One of the videos was widely shared, triggering difficult but necessary conversations about inclusion and exclusion in Pangasinan literature. These were conversations I once only had in my head. Now everyone is talking about them.\nMy increased involvement within the Pangasinan writing community this month peaked when I submitted a proposal for the creation of a Pangasinan writers group within the lone Pangasinan cultural and literary group based in the province, the Ulopan na Pansiyansiya\u0026rsquo;y Salitan Pangasinan (UPSP). I\u0026rsquo;m also drafting a proposal that, once approved, would receive funding for the first second writers workshop purely in the Pangasinan language.\nThe biggest challenge so far in writing the latter proposal is finding writers willing to be panelists in the workshop. Pangasinan writers are so few and many are still young in their literary use of the language (including myself) that some feel inadequate and unqualified. But a language with almost no writers shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be expected to yield literary gods who are already credentialed, workshopped, and institutionalized. This expectation is impossible to meet at this point. A language like Pangasinan, which has such a weak literary production, should be forgiving of its current \u0026ldquo;experts.\u0026rdquo; Writers working in the language should forgive themselves for their inadequacies and step up despite their lack of qualifications. They are qualified because they have the courage to write in a language where almost no one is reading. The mere fact that their peers recommend them is enough credential.\nEn route back home to Los Baños, I stayed around Manila for a couple of days. I visited the large Fully Booked branch at SM Mall of Asia and the La Solidaridad Bookshop, founded by F. Sionil Jose, the Filipino National Artist and one of Pangasinan\u0026rsquo;s preeminent and prolific writers. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit ashamed to admit that it was also my first time visiting Luneta Park, the place where Jose Rizal and the three martyr priests were executed.\nSo We Must Meet Apart #This July, my friend Jesa Suganob and I launched a zine called \u0026ldquo;So We Must Meet Apart.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s my first zine and collaboration with a fellow writer whose work I deeply respect and admire.\n\u0026ldquo;So We Must Meet Apart\u0026rdquo; was an experimental project that used walking as a method and platform for writing epistolary essays. The process was simple: Jesa walked around Cagayan de Oro City while I walked around Los Baños. During or after each walk, we wrote letters to each other. We sent and read them only after the experiment ended, and then we processed everything through a written dialogue that became an afterword.\nThe experiment was surprisingly demanding. The letters explored diverse subjects—body, gender, religion, mental health, grief, poetry—and bordered on confessions. Around this time, I was reading Jhoanna Lynn Cruz\u0026rsquo;s book [[abi nako cruz|Abi Nako]], which challenged me to reveal things I hadn\u0026rsquo;t before.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve already sold several digital and physical copies of the zine. If you are interested in getting a digital copy of the zine but your are outside the Philippines, please check this link to buy a copy.\nWorking on the physical production of the zine gave me a first-hand experience of what it means to be a cultural worker and seize my work\u0026rsquo;s means of production. After spending an entire day producing the second batch of \u0026ldquo;So We Must Meet Apart\u0026rdquo;—scouting for a better paper, having the copies printed, negotiating to keep the price of printing as low as possible, binding the zines myself by drilling holes in their spines and manually inserting staples in them (because a stapler wasn\u0026rsquo;t available at the printer), and shipping some myself—questions about the flow of money in an endeavor such as zine-making scampered around my head.\nHow can we keep the price of production low and, therefore, the zine cost low without compromising the project\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic objectives? Is raising the quality of materials used in producing it against the tradition of zine-making? If I use thicker paper or more durable ink, is my zine bourgeois?\nSince this is collaborative work, how do we share earnings? Who will spend on production? Who will receive payments? What will happen with earnings? Will it return to production?\nWhile thinking about these questions, someone called outside our door. I looked outside the window and saw a man about my age with a bag on his back and two pieces of small paper in his hands. I went down to talk to him.\nHis name was Jayson. When I asked him what he needed, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t look at me directly. He apologized for disturbing us and then expressed his purpose for calling. He said that he intended to visit the Mormon missionaries who live in the apartment unit next to us because they visit him at the house he is renting with his family nearby. However, the missionaries were not around, so he took the courage to call on our door.\nHe said her mom has been suffering from kidney failure, and irregular dialysis has caused toxins to reach her lungs. He said that help from the government arrives so slow and isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a job, so going around and asking for help is what he can only do to help her mom. I asked him how old she was. He said she was 44.\nI went back upstairs to get some money to give to Jayson. When I handed it to him, Jayson went near, so I held his shoulders with my arms and told him to take care on his way home. I expressed hope that her mother gets the dialysis she needs.\nWhen I returned upstairs, I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. I remembered my mom who is turning sixty in a couple of years. That was when I realized I may have given all the profits I could make from the batch of the zines I printed.\n","date":"2 August 2024","permalink":"/uman/021/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 021 — July 2024"},{"content":"Uman friends,\nI almost gave up on writing this issue. The first two weeks of July were synonymous with sickness. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy to get anything going. So, rest and more rest was what I did. Alas, things felt a little bit better today, so I opened my laptop and started typing these words.\nHere, behold, is a quick roundup of June.\nPalihang Rogelio Sicat 17 (PRS 17) # The highlight of June was the seventeenth iteration of the Palihang Rogelio Sicat (PRS 17), of which I became a fellow for poetry. The Tagalog word \u0026ldquo;palihan\u0026rdquo; means anvil and is the Tagalog literati\u0026rsquo;s chosen translation for the English word \u0026ldquo;workshop.\u0026rdquo; The image is a craftsperson hitting their newly smelted steel on an anvil to shape it into a tool or weapon of choice. Ideally, a writers\u0026rsquo; workshop functions this way. The newly smelted steel is a draft of a poem, essay, short story, or play. We lay it over the anvil (the palihan), where we fellows, craftspersons that we are, hit it with feedback that, given correctly, hopefully molds the metal into the right shape.\nThe \u0026ldquo;right shape\u0026rdquo; is often tricky because everyone has an opinion on how the piece must be shaped. This is where close reading and listening become essential. Without fellows reading the piece as closely as possible, with every ounce of their empathy, it would be impossible to glimpse the natural shape the piece is trying to take and provide feedback that the writer needs to hear. Likewise, without the writer listening as closely as possible to what the fellows are saying, it is impossible to decipher the piece\u0026rsquo;s most critical loopholes and blind spots.\nWorkshops are usually scheduled for five days, with three of those days as the core, when pieces are discussed. With PRS 17, we started very early (around 8 in the morning) and ended up until 9 in the evening, with a few hours of rest in between sessions. I\u0026rsquo;ve only experienced two writers\u0026rsquo; workshops so far, but I can\u0026rsquo;t help but notice their similarities with sesshins or zen retreats. A sesshin also typically last five days, with three of those days as full-day retreats. If writers\u0026rsquo; workshops have a single core activity, i.e., reading and giving comments to literary works, sesshins also revolve around a core activity: sitting silently while counting one\u0026rsquo;s breaths. The length of focused time dedicated to both activities and the repetitions entailed in engaging in them produce effects that aren\u0026rsquo;t often experienced in everyday life. Suddenly, writing (and reading) becomes a lot easier. Suddenly, finding peace of mind becomes more possible, especially during the first few days after a sesshin. Even during a writers\u0026rsquo; workshop or a sesshin, brief visions and insights often occur—enough to sustain or inspire one\u0026rsquo;s writing or meditation practice.\nFor example, PRS 17 was my first immersion in playwriting. While I\u0026rsquo;ve written plays as a high school student—an activity I really enjoyed—I\u0026rsquo;ve never had experience doing it today as a professional writer. After reading and providing feedback on three plays during the workshop, I found a new interest in plays and the courage to try writing one in the coming weeks. In preparation for this new writing adventure, I watched the one-act play of Jon Santos called \u0026ldquo;Bawat Bonggang Bagay,\u0026rdquo; a translation of Duncan MacMillan and Johnny Donahoe\u0026rsquo;s interactive play \u0026ldquo;Every Brilliant Thing.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m also currently reading Virgin Po (Muli) Ako (I\u0026rsquo;m a Virgin Again) by Reuel Molina Aguila, a beginner\u0026rsquo;s friendly guide (of sorts) to writing one-act plays.\nObong #The piece that landed me a spot at the PRS 17 was a poem I wrote last year called [[obong|Obong]] or \u0026ldquo;Nest.\u0026rdquo; The original was written in [[04 notes/pangasinan|Pangasinan]], the language I spoke growing up, but since the workshop was in Filipino, I translated the poem into Filipino. One of the highlights of my PRS 17 experience was reading the poem in its original in front of my co-fellows before they discussed it. This experience was significant because Pangasinan literature is at a really low point these days, a fact that pierces my conscience as a Pangasinan writer who writes primarily in English. I write a few of my poems in this language and publish them wherever I can to contribute to reviving Pangasinan literature, a task left in the hands of writers whose number could literally be counted by just two hands.\nI received helpful feedback from my co-fellows and a panel of seasoned veteran writers. It was also a privilege to have the stanzas of my poem translated into other Filipino languages—the languages of four other co-fellows from different parts of the Philippines—and performed at the closing ceremony of PRS 17. I\u0026rsquo;m currently revising the poem based on the feedback I received from the workshop, before I send it to an online publication where it, hopefully, would find a home.\nReading through Vincenz Serrano\u0026rsquo;s Walking Syllabus #A second highlight of my month was my deepened study of [[04 notes/walking]]. It\u0026rsquo;s a long time coming, but I finally started reading the resources listed in [[vincenz serrano|Vincenz Serrano\u0026rsquo;s]] syllabus of his walking class at the Ateneo de Manila University. I\u0026rsquo;m doing this in preparation for a few walks I plan to do (as soon as my health gets to a hundred percent). Among these walks is tracing [[teodora alonzo walks|Teodora Alonzo\u0026rsquo;s walk from Calamba to Santa Cruz]]. Teodora Alonzo is the mother of Filipino national hero Jose Rizal. At age 45, she was made to walk some 50 kilometers from their house at Calamba to the nearest provincial jail, where she was incarcerated for a crime she was innocent of. Since I live in Los Baños, halfway through these two locations, I decided to try the walk myself. My reflections on my readings gave birth to some ideas on [[how to walk the philippines|how to walk the Philippines]], ideas that would be critical in writing about future walks, including this Teodora Alonzo walk. In other walking news, the only [[05 obsidian/tags/tlw|TLW]] issue I managed to release in June was entitled \u0026ldquo;[[the walker who greets another body|The Walker Who Greets Another Body]].\u0026rdquo;\nHere ends this short Uman issue. Thank you for reading, and I hope to see you again next month.\n","date":"4 July 2024","permalink":"/uman/020/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 020 — June 2024"},{"content":" Around 30 minutes ago, it started drizzling outside, creating a thick film of moisture on my window. Since the film formed outside, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wipe it away, and it blocked my view of the landmarks we were passing by. Fearing I might miss my stop, I fixed my eyes on the map on my phone, watching as the circle moved along the blue line.\nI arrived at Lozano Junction around 5:00 PM. As I got off the bus, I noticed the drizzle had already ended, leaving puddles on the poorly constructed road. A car whooshed by, hitting a large puddle and splashing water on the other side of the bus. I waited for the bus to move, along with the line of vehicles that formed behind it before I crossed the highway. Seeing that I was clearing the pedestrian lane, a lady ran to join me.\nAcross the junction is the Maronong Road, leading to my parents\u0026rsquo; house, where I\u0026rsquo;m staying for a few days to attend a literary conference. Usually, three or four tricycles are waiting for passengers at the mouth of the road. This time, there was only one, and it was already full. As I stopped by the waiting shed, the tricycle\u0026rsquo;s engine whirred as the driver stepped on the accelerator, leaving me alone.\nI took the moment to take the scent of freshly wet grass and the cool air. I looked at the road ahead, where a group of youngsters was already walking. Surely, they weren\u0026rsquo;t heading as far as Sitio Bayog. But all signs tell me I have to follow them. I took the first step of what would be a 30-minute walk. `` The rain had left minimal traces on the ground. Except for several puddles along the edges, the concrete road was dry. I walked on the left side, sharing it with approaching vehicles. Drivers were kind enough to move aside as they saw me coming. I gazed at the vast fields of green palay on my left, trusting that incoming traffic wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt me.\nWhen the side of the road widened, I gave the whole road to the motorists. In this country, locals understand that concrete roads, although built for things with wheels, are also for the many who still travel on foot. In rural Philippines, walking isn\u0026rsquo;t a conscious cultural act that inspires insights, verses, and art. It\u0026rsquo;s simply a practical mode of travel to move bodies and goods from one point to another.\nAs I approached a bridge built over a tributary of the Sinucalan River, I saw a man, possibly in his 50s or 60s, standing on the side of the bridge in front of his motorcycle. He was obviously from nearby. He watched and listened as the river, replenished by the rain, rushed below the bridge.\nI greeted him in Pangasinan, \u0026ldquo;Ngarem ed sikayo\u0026rdquo; (Good afternoon). But he didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to hear it. He responded in Tagalog, \u0026ldquo;Buti nalang katatapos lang ng ulan!\u0026rdquo; (Good thing it just rained!). \u0026ldquo;Oo nga po eh. Malamig,\u0026rdquo; I replied in Tagalog as I continued walking.\nAs the man grew smaller in the distance, I pondered our brief exchange. Why did he speak to me in Tagalog? He surely didn\u0026rsquo;t hear me talk in Pangasinan. There is only one explanation: locals opt to speak Tagalog to those who look too young to know Pangasinan (and I certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t look too young!) or (the more likely explanation) those who look too strange to be considered locals. I wondered what made me seem out of place. Was it my shoes, my large bag, or the fact that I was walking instead of waiting for the next tricycle? It could have been all of these.\nAfter covering the first two kilometers and entering my last, I passed an older man carrying a young child in his arms, possibly a two-year-old. The man walked outside the gate of what seemed to be their house. I greeted him too, \u0026ldquo;Ngarem ed sikayo,\u0026rdquo; and he responded with a smile and some words I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite catch.\nWalking and greeting people felt good. These were people living a couple of kilometers away from my parents. Some might even have been customers of my vet father. Some could even be distant relatives. There\u0026rsquo;s no better place to practice greeting people while walking than in these parts.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t always easy greeting people on my walks. Almost all my walks were solitary retreats meant to get away from people as much as possible. But as I matured in my understanding of why we walk and why we live, the concept of kapwa (the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo;) occupied my mind more and more during my walks. In a country where people often walk to earn a living, ask for alms, suffer under colonizers, protest, and are repeatedly denied their requests, how can I walk better?\nI passed by a group of older people, all women, walking in the opposite direction. I\u0026rsquo;ve walked this road several times, and I can\u0026rsquo;t help but notice that most people I meet here are older adults. While the youngsters zoomed beside them on their motorcycles, these people, some already frail in body, chose to walk to get to where they needed to be. Give me ten more years, and there would be no one to greet on this road. Everyone alive would be these youngsters filling the road with motorbikes and cars. This gives me another good reason to walk as much as I can.\nAlthough I didn\u0026rsquo;t speak, I smiled at the women wide enough to radiate my newfound confidence. Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s always a risk in trying to connect with strangers through a short greeting or a smile. There\u0026rsquo;s a risk that one\u0026rsquo;s gesture of goodwill won\u0026rsquo;t be reciprocated. So, framing these actions as \u0026ldquo;practices\u0026rdquo; is helpful. We do them for the sake of doing them, not for an outcome beyond our control.\nSometimes, no matter how much energy we put into a greeting, no matter how far out of our comfort zone we reach, people don\u0026rsquo;t reciprocate. And it isn\u0026rsquo;t entirely their fault. We now live in a world where it is easy to ignore gestures of goodwill and overlook the recognition of our existence. We\u0026rsquo;ve been alienated long enough to accept this as our default reality.\nBut walking constantly reminds me that the default isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily correct, and there is always an opportunity to create better defaults. [[wanderlust solnit|Rebecca Solnit]] said, \u0026ldquo;Walking is one way of maintaining a bulwark against this erosion of the mind, the body, the landscape, and the city, and every walker is a guard on patrol to protect the ineffable.\u0026rdquo;\nSometimes, the walker who greets another body receives no response. When the walker is lucky, as I was with this group of women, about half of them smile back. And that response is as good as any other. It is enough fuel for the long walk ahead.\n","date":"30 June 2024","permalink":"/tlw/036/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"The Walker Who Greets Another Body"},{"content":"May was surprisingly open. While I did spend more time working for money this month, I had no personal projects (i.e., writing, photography, or walking) scheduled. This gave me more time to think about my free, creative spirituality ([[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]]).\nI experimented with a couple of things in May. First, me and my partner, Lea, instituted a [[kiitsu kyokai|kiitsu kyōkai]] practice that involved walking to a secluded place in nature, meditating, reading a prompt from the [[calendar of wisdom tolstoy|Calendar of Wisdom]] by [[leo tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]], free writing about the prompt, and discussing whatever we wrote. I wrote about the practice in my newsletter article [[a sunday walk|\u0026ldquo;A Sunday Walk\u0026rdquo;]], which I shared on Facebook. Many friends resonated with the idea that performing a regular spiritual practice with a significant other could be an alternative to attending church, something I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting, especially in a very religious Filipino culture.\nA second experiment I did this month that worked well was scheduling an hour of meaningful spiritual conversation with a friend. I pitched the idea to this friend, whom I\u0026rsquo;ve been conversing with sporadically for the past three years after I felt like a more regular conversation could benefit both of us. After the first session, which was purely a catch-up, we tried doing something similar to what Lea and I did. We meditated, read a prompt, wrote together, and talked freely. I\u0026rsquo;m learning a lot from my friend and our conversations, and he is enjoying them, too, so we plan to continue with them in the coming weeks.\nAround the middle of May, I spent an entire morning translating [[shinichiro imaoka|Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s]] [[imaoka principles of living|Principles of Living]], both the 1973 and the 1981 versions. While they\u0026rsquo;re still far from final, the translations helped me understand Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s ideas better in the context of my culture. If you speak Filipino, here they are: [[imaoka mga simulain ko sa pamumuhay|Mga Simulain ko sa Pamumuhay ni Imaoka Shin’ichirō]].\nThe most significant leap of faith I took this month was finally confronting the idea of [[god|God]] after years of avoiding it. As I explained in my essay [[bathala wala intro|\u0026ldquo;Bathala Wala\u0026rdquo; (Part One): Confronting \u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo; on the Mt. Makiling Trail]], I was moved by my conversation with Lea during our first kiitsu kyōkai walk to rethink my metaphysical beliefs, including my non-belief in God. To examine my reasons for disbelieving in a personal God, I started exploring the works of [[john schellenberg|John Schellenberg]], including his book [[divine hiddenness and human reason schellenberg|Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason]], which introduced the [[hiddenness argument]] of [[atheism]]. I also opened myself up to alternative conceptions of God, such as [[baruch spinoza|Bruch Spinoza\u0026rsquo;s]] [[god or nature|\u0026ldquo;God or Nature\u0026rdquo;]], [[wieman minimalist definition of god|Henry Wieman\u0026rsquo;s minimalist definition of God]], [[dewey concept of god|Dewey\u0026rsquo;s concept of God]], and the radical postmodern idea of God as an event by [[john caputo|John D. Caputo]]. In the weeks ahead, I intend to delve deeper into these possibilities, hoping to settle on at least one explanation I am comfortable with.\nIn other news, I wrote another essay, [[never finished never arrived|\u0026ldquo;Never Finished, Never Arrived\u0026rdquo;]], about the importance of journaling in a spiritual life. I was also accepted in my second writer\u0026rsquo;s workshop, which I intend to write about in next month\u0026rsquo;s issue.\n","date":"12 June 2024","permalink":"/uman/019/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 019 — May 2024"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;Bathala nawa.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is a unique phrase that some of my friends use to conclude their sentences. The last time I encountered it was in a Facebook comment, where a friend signed off with \u0026ldquo;ingat kapatid. BHL NW\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;take care brother. BHL NW\u0026rdquo;). I deduced that \u0026ldquo;BHL NW\u0026rdquo; was a shorthand for \u0026ldquo;Bathala nawa,\u0026rdquo; a phrase written without vowels in the ancient Tagalog script, known as baybayin.\nThe use of \u0026lsquo;Bathala nawa\u0026rsquo; is not widespread, but it is prevalent among a specific group of people I know. These individuals are either directly or indirectly associated with a contemporary movement that seeks to revive precolonial Filipino spirituality and incorporate it into modern life.1\n\u0026ldquo;Bathala nawa\u0026rdquo; is a Tagalog phrase. I have yet to encounter a similar expression in Pangasinan, the language I spoke growing up. I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked closely at the phrase, but I know enough to make a few points about it.\nThe phrase comprises two Tagalog words: \u0026ldquo;Bathala\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;nawa.\u0026rdquo; Bathala is the name of the most powerful god in Tagalog mythology. Like all the other ethnolinguistic groups in the Philippines, the Tagalogs have multiple gods, but Bathala is usually described as the most powerful. Among the Igorots (\u0026ldquo;people of the mountain\u0026rdquo;) in the northern Philippines, a similar god is called Kabunyian. The existence of an all-powerful god, such as Bathala or Kabuniyan, is one reason why the natives quickly accepted Western monotheism\u0026rsquo;s concept of the one true [[god|\u0026ldquo;God\u0026rdquo;]], leading to its dominance throughout the Philippines from the 1500s until now.\nOn the other hand, \u0026ldquo;Nawa\u0026rdquo; is a word that is more difficult to define. In ancient Tagalog, as an adjective, it refers to something that isn\u0026rsquo;t easily done. In contemporary usage, \u0026ldquo;nawa\u0026rdquo; expresses hope, as in \u0026ldquo;may it happen.\u0026rdquo; Combining ancient and modern usage, one could understand \u0026ldquo;nawa\u0026rdquo; as an expression of hope that things that don\u0026rsquo;t easily happen happen. Taken as a whole, \u0026ldquo;Bathala nawa\u0026rdquo; could mean \u0026ldquo;May Bathala will it to happen.\u0026rdquo; A Christianized interpretation I read somewhere translates it as \u0026ldquo;May Bathala\u0026rsquo;s will be done.\u0026rdquo;\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t hear this phrase used in current everyday Tagalog. However, a derivative of the phrase is one of the most common phrases in the language: \u0026ldquo;Bahala na.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Bahala na\u0026rdquo; is what you would say when faced with a situation where almost everything is beyond your control and that certainty, especially of any favorable outcome, is impossible. You say \u0026ldquo;Bahala na\u0026rdquo; to recognize that you will do whatever is left for you to do, but that you are letting whoever has control of the rest (historically, \u0026ldquo;Bathala\u0026rdquo;) determine the outcome.\nWhile I may sometimes use \u0026ldquo;bahala na,\u0026rdquo; I use it stripped of any mythological or religious sense. I have never used the phrase \u0026ldquo;Bathala nawa\u0026rdquo; because, even if the phrase is situated outside the Christian tradition that has dominated the religious consciousness of these islands for more than five centuries, it still is anchored to the belief that an all-powerful being looking down at us somewhere from the sky rules our lives and dictates the trajectory of everything. While I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the first eighteen years of my life developing a relationship with such a being, it is a pursuit I have long since abandoned. And with this abandon came the play of words: \u0026ldquo;Bathala nawa\u0026rdquo; has become, at least for me, \u0026ldquo;Bathala wala\u0026rdquo; (\u0026ldquo;Bathala none\u0026rdquo;).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve tried to avoid thinking about the idea of God since around 2012 [[a never-ending walk|when I left the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses]]. Of course, I continued to encounter the word even after I left organized religion. Theism, specifically monotheism, is believed by the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. If I\u0026rsquo;m going to make an estimate, I would confidently say that around 99 percent of Filipinos are theists, and almost all theists are monotheists.2 So, it is impossible not to encounter the idea. It is everywhere, and since I chose to hang around spiritual circles in search of the next best thing to fill the void left by my childhood faith, this meant I encountered the idea repeatedly, even after leaving my religion.\nSince 2012, when God has been mentioned casually in conversations with friends and family, the concept has had little meaning to me. However, when it became the subject of more serious discussions, like when my friends philosophize over it or share their experiences of feeling God in their lives, old feelings about the concept were triggered, and I felt very uncomfortable. My partner told me recently that whenever this happened, I usually grew silent and withdrew from the conversation.\nWhen I think about it long and hard, there was a point in my life when I stopped believing in God and another point when I stopped caring about God. When precisely these two things happened, I can\u0026rsquo;t say.\nHowever, it is important to emphasize their differences. You could stop believing in God, but that disbelief could spur you to think even more about the concept. Your disbelief becomes a fuel that motivates you to get to the bottom of it and find the truth about God\u0026rsquo;s nature.\nBut it is also possible to stop believing in God and caring about the matter. You stop thinking about God\u0026rsquo;s characteristics and how God\u0026rsquo;s existence is possible. As the years passed after leaving the JWs, I saw myself becoming increasingly someone who no longer cares about God.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t wholly reflected on this distancing from a concept that once organized and directed my life. I have a good hunch that during all those years of ministry with the JWs, I built a relationship with this imaginary being that I firmly believed to be genuine, and the breakage of this relationship was too emotionally hurtful to revisit. And so, like all other aspects of my previous religion, I avoided thinking about God.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t help that I lacked the right people and community to think critically about the concept of God. I met individuals who were already entirely sure of their faith in this one true God and left no space for doubt in their religious or spiritual lives. I have a big problem with this way of being in the world. Doubt was the very reason why I left the JWs. To disbelieve a specific worldview because of doubt only to agree to another worldview immediately doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem reasonable. It defeats the very purpose of why I left.\nIn retrospect, this lack of a shared safe space where I could confront my disbelief with God in a way that is sensitive to my past and honors the process I went through to get here was the number one reason why I avoided confronting the concept of God. Lacking this space but in need of community, I settled with available religious and spiritual communities that gave almost zero space to doubt and who never entertained liberal questions about their own beliefs, including that of God.\nSo why am I confronting the idea of God now?\nThere are two reasons: one internal, the other external.\nMy internal reason: There have been times (and they\u0026rsquo;re becoming more frequent recently) when I felt the urge to pray, that is, to converse using words to whatever this thing is out there that is the object of all my \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; actions. When I walk, I can feel a connection to the place and the humans and non-humans that inhabit the place, and I feel an urge to express what I am feeling using words. As a writer who exists almost every day surrounded by letters, I know that being able to do this is a big thing. But without me confronting the available ideas behind the word \u0026ldquo;God,\u0026rdquo; I feel an uncomfortable resistance to converse with this reality, which also seems to hinder my ability to connect with it during my walks.\nMy external reason came to me during a walk with my partner, Lea, which I wrote about in [[a sunday walk|a previous issue of this newsletter]]. Another reason I actively avoided thinking about God is that the idea is loaded with so much metaphysics (i.e., questions and answers about what fundamentally exists). While metaphysics profoundly interests me, people too obsessed with metaphysical questions tend to feel so strongly about their beliefs that conversations with them often lead to heated debates. I share the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s stand: he avoided answering his disciples\u0026rsquo; metaphysical questions because he thought they were obstacles to what was most important—practicing compassion toward others.\nBut hearing how Lea is still profoundly disturbed by things taught to her as a child about what exists—hell, Satan, God, etc.—made me think about the importance of confronting metaphysical questions. For many of us, facing these questions (no matter how difficult such an undertaking is) is the only way to move forward, to find closure to a traumatic past centered around beliefs that did more damage than to protect us, so that we could finally open ourselves to healthier ways of looking at and being in the world. Lea has helped me realize that avoiding ideas about God is preventing me from truly making peace with my religious past, a requirement in crafting [[jiyu shukyo|a new free and creative spirituality]].\nIn the following weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ll work on a series of essays to share how I\u0026rsquo;m currently confronting the idea of God. The essays will document my recollections of how I used the concept in the past and articulate how I\u0026rsquo;m considering available reimaginings of the idea through reading and reflection. As I often do, I\u0026rsquo;ll use [[walking]] as a platform for processing and reflection. Since I anticipate that [[nature]] will be integral in thinking through the idea of God, I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing the walks on the most accessible nature path where I live: the Mt. Makiling Trail.\nInstead of consecutive days of walking like I did during my [[rxg|Roots x Gravel]] and [[tall tales 1|Tall Tales]] walks, I\u0026rsquo;ll do a series of walks spread out through several weeks with a maximum of one walk per week. I won\u0026rsquo;t be giving a cap on the number of walks I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing; this project ends when I\u0026rsquo;ve arrived somewhere comfortable enough to move on. I\u0026rsquo;m not seeking any form of finality since I don\u0026rsquo;t think we\u0026rsquo;ll ever get clear about these things. But I hope to understand the object of my devotion better and whether I still feel comfortable calling that \u0026ldquo;God.\u0026rdquo;\nThe first few walks will be purely recollections—unearthing childhood and early adolescence memories about my relationship with \u0026ldquo;God.\u0026rdquo; After these recollections, I will combine reading and walking; that is, I\u0026rsquo;ll read a few days before the walk and hold these ideas during the walk as triggers to new lines of thought that the road will generate. The following list is not final, but it\u0026rsquo;s a good starting point for what these walks would be about:\nWalk 1: A recollection of my concept of God growing up as a child. Walk 2: A recollection of ideas that made me disbelieve in God. Walk 3: A recollection of my switch from radical atheism to nontheism. Walk 4: Pondering God as the immovable mover. Walk 5: Pondering God as nature. Walk 6: Pondering God as an event. Etc. Walks 4 onwards would be reflections on readings about God, so if there are books or articles you think I should consider for this project, I would appreciate it if you send them my way.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll still combine photography and writing with the walks, but I will prioritize my thought process, so I\u0026rsquo;m anticipating that I\u0026rsquo;ll take fewer photographs than on previous walks.\nThis essay is an introduction for the following essays to come, but this also serves as an invitation to anyone who would like to come along. If you know anyone who might benefit, please send them this newsletter. I don\u0026rsquo;t know when I\u0026rsquo;ll do the first walk. The wet season may have already started in my part of the world, welcoming us with the first tropical cyclone of the year, so walking the Mt. Makiling trail could be tricky. But I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to walk in the weeks to come.\nThank you for being here.\nThe idea of a \u0026ldquo;Filipino spirituality\u0026rdquo; is inherently problematic because what is often described as Filipino is just one of the almost two hundred ethnolinguistic groups scattered across the Philippine archipelago. It is easy to make the mistake that Filipino culture is the culture of the people who live in Manila, the country\u0026rsquo;s capital, and its surrounding provinces: the Tagalogs (\u0026ldquo;people by the river\u0026rdquo;).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nData from the 2020 Census confirm my hunch. According to the census, only 0.04 percent (or around 43,000) of Filipinos had no religious affiliation. Not all of the irreligious are atheists, of course. If I\u0026rsquo;m going to make another guess, the majority of these 43,000 Filipinos are still theists, but they are simply non-churchgoers. A smaller segment would be those who call themselves \u0026ldquo;spiritual but not religious.\u0026rdquo; These people still tend to be theists, but they worship God in the context of \u0026ldquo;spiritual communities,\u0026rdquo; many of which adhere to some form of New Age or Eastern spirituality.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"25 May 2024","permalink":"/tlw/035/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"\"Bathala Wala\" (Part One): Confronting \"God\" on the Mt. Makiling Trail"},{"content":" New journal. A beautiful one. Hardbound. Which means easier writing. And thoughts protected for years to come. This is quite possibly the best I\u0026rsquo;ve bought in recent memory.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been hunting down cheap, blank notebooks like this since 2018, when I started writing down one to three pages of my thoughts every morning after doing a few minutes of meditation. Julia Cameroon calls the practice \u0026ldquo;morning pages.\u0026rdquo; I call it \u0026ldquo;whatever comes, comes.\u0026rdquo; Because that is exactly what it looks like.\nSome days, I would write these lengthy, logically curated essays about some philosophical question I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about for days, only to be followed by days with entries filled with lists of things to do: bathe the cats, follow up an invoice, replace that broken doorknob, etc. And that is why I laugh when I see these articles online differentiating between a diary and a journal, calling the former a record of things that happened in a day and the latter a laboratory of academic and artistic pursuits. My notebooks are practically the same.\nLately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about [[uman 2024-04|the role of writing in a spiritual life]] and how a writing practice could be designed to facilitate a free, creative spirituality or [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]]—a direct antithesis to conventional religion that is overprotective of tradition and, therefore, static. After giving it some thought, I\u0026rsquo;m convinced that the [[draft]], that seemingly \u0026ldquo;never finished, never arrived\u0026rdquo; literary specimen, where the journal is a subcategory, could be a potent tool for a person committed to this similarly \u0026ldquo;never finished, never arrived\u0026rdquo; brand of spirituality.\nOf course, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t arrive at this conclusion had I not been profoundly moved by reading journals. While dipping my toes into walking, I read [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s]] journals and [[translating thoreau journal|translated my favorite entries into Filipino]]. Having transferred to Los Baños and started a walking practice around Mt. Makiling, I started reading [[henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s]] philosophy book in journal form called [[the inward morning bugbee|The Inward Morning]]. Both journals influenced how I saw the world these past years, mainly as I got serious with walking.\nSince then, I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a penchant for published journals, buying them whenever I can. In the Philippines, the journal is a marginalized literary genre, and writers don\u0026rsquo;t usually publish theirs, and studies of journals are hard to come by. This is why when I saw a copy of Kapag Sumalupa ang Gunita, a collection of selected journal entries by the Filipino novelist and playwright Rogelio Sicat, sold at Mt. Cloud Bookshop at Baguio during [[tall tales 1|my walk there last January]], I didn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to buy it.\nAfter reading Thoreau and Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s journals, I feel like the draft is the literature of walking, specifically the walking theorized by the French called [[derive|dérive]], an unplanned walk through a particular landscape. The \u0026ldquo;never finished, never arrived\u0026rdquo; quality that one experiences when doing an unplanned dérive, an act focused on the process rather than the product, is captured well with the fleeting pages of the draft-like journal, which itself is \u0026ldquo;never finished, never arrived.\u0026rdquo; This liminal quality of the journal frees the walker to write what arrives to them during the walk without the pressure one often feels when one needs to publish.\nConsider this: if the journal can capture the wandering, fragmented thoughts that arise during a dérive, it can also encapsulate the similarly meandering, shattered fragments of thought that emerge from a mind dedicated to a positionless spirituality like jiyū shūkyō. In this light, the journal emerges as the most fitting vessel to house the trajectories of a free, creative spirituality.\nWith the aim of understanding why the journal and jiyū shūkyo are a perfect match, I penned down the following points in my journal.\nThe journal always begins with the self. The only audience of the journal is the writer themself. While there is a modern understanding that a writer\u0026rsquo;s journal may be eventually released to the public, which may affect how a journal is written, a journal entry begins as a private project at the time of its conception. A journal\u0026rsquo;s first goal is to help the writer confront their inner battles and clarify things for themself. The journal pages become a battleground for a writer\u0026rsquo;s inner life. The journal does not arrive. Unlike a book with a clear structure and a rationale behind the arrangement of its elements, the journal is only ordered by (1) time and (2) its source (the writer). The arrangement of the contents of a journal could only be interpreted as the movement of a single person\u0026rsquo;s mind through time. That movement does not end conclusively with an insight or a final revelation. No. It only ends when the mind stops moving. This happens when, as is the case of Thoreau, the writer dies, or, as with Bugbee, the writer decides to stop. The journal is always tentative and ever-changing. A journal entry could contradict an earlier entry, and this is expected. Unlike a book where internal logical contradiction is checked during the editorial process, a journal doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about consistency. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t correct itself. It accepts that what is written was written and that the only way forward is forward. A journal entry and a journal as a whole are never final, even if they could imbue an aura of finality. A religious or spiritual life, especially one committed to a dynamic spirituality that embraces change and transformation, is also always tentative and ever-changing, making it the perfect content for a journal. The journal is a collage. Journal entries taken as a whole may not just be contradictory. They can also contain multiple interests and subject matters, a tendency that is also noticeable in the searching mind of a spiritual seeker. But these writing pieces are collected in one place, unified by one mind. The journal is, therefore, a collage. As a collage, the journal becomes a creative and material proof that, unlike fossilized religious beliefs, vibrant, contradictory, and ever-changing ideas could exist in one place and embody a certain measure of beautiful writing. As a collage, the journal symbolizes intellectual pluralism and inclusion. The journal is a launchpad for public work. Writers like Annie Dillard and David Sedaris use their journals as a laboratory for outward-looking works. The form and practice are flexible enough to hold private and public spheres within its pages. A true spiritual life doesn\u0026rsquo;t stay inside the comforts of privacy and self. It must eventually embrace a public life—much like a writer or artist does. The journal captures, encourages, and even facilitates this metamorphosis. Of course, I wrote all these in the safe confines of my journal, going through them now, editing them before I send them to you. But even published works like this essay you are probably reading in your email or as a page on my website could still be considered drafts. It\u0026rsquo;s all a matter of perspective. And because they are written and published electronically, it is very easy to revise and reshare them.\nThis is how I see my writings these days, an archive of loose drafts that haven\u0026rsquo;t really ended, much like the form of spirituality I sought to study and practice, a spirituality captured by A. R. Ammons\u0026rsquo; confession in his poem Corsons Inlet:\nI will try\nto fasten into order enlarging grasps of disorder,\nwidening\nscope, but enjoying the freedom that\nScope eludes my grasp, that there is no finality of vision,\nthat I have perceived nothing completely,\nthat tomorrow a new walk is a new walk.\n","date":"18 May 2024","permalink":"/tlw/034/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Never Finished, Never Arrived: Journal as Literature for a Free, Creative Spirituality"},{"content":" Last Sunday, my partner Lea and I decided to walk inside the University of the Philippines campus near our house. We hiked Lantican Avenue, one of the two roads ascending toward Mt. Makiling. This road leads to the College of Forestry, the last part of the campus before the first station of the Mt. Makiling Trail.\nAt night, especially on weekends when there are no classes, the study sheds built under the large trees that cover the college remain lit and vacant. Lea and I walked toward these sheds and picked one to settle on. That night, only one other couple used a shed away from ours. They murmured, perhaps also enjoying the silence of the place occasionally broken by the gentle trills of cicadas.\nLea and I decided to walk that night in response to a feeling that has been grown between us for quite some time now. We\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to start a shared practice that could ground us to thoughts and questions that often fall on the wayside during our busy weeks. I have my own practices: I see my writing, photography, and walking as different expressions of my spirituality. But these are often done alone. What Lea and I needed was a practice we could share. However, since we have intentionally distanced ourselves from any local church, congregation, or spiritual group, we don\u0026rsquo;t have that structure readily available to confront perennial thoughts and questions. We knew we had to build that structure ourselves.\nEvery other Thursday, I join a small group of individuals from different parts of the world to explore how to create and practice a profoundly liberating form of spirituality grounded in interdependence with community and nature. The group calls itself Kiitsū Kyōkai, after a local community founded by [[shinichiro imaoka|Imaoka Shin’ichirō (1881-1988)]] in Japan after the Second World War but which disappeared after he died. The [[kiitsu kyokai|Kiitsū Kyōkai]] format is highly minimalist. It has only two parts: meditation followed by free conversation.\nI proposed to Lea that we follow a similar simple structure for our walk, but with the addition of several elements unique to our needs. The thirty-minute walk from our house to the sheds was already part of our structure. The walk was a meditation of itself, which grounded us to our bodies, to each other (through whatever conversations and pauses arise during the walk), and to place. When we settled in the shed, we did a short five-minute silent breathing meditation to help our minds slow down and amplify the peace we found while walking. We know how to meditate but follow different techniques, so we used what was comfortable for each of us.\nSince we are both avid diarists, we agreed to use free writing as an entryway to free conversation. To prompt the journaling session, I opened my phone to read a portion of an ebook version of Leo Tolstoy\u0026rsquo;s Calendar of Wisdom, a book that contains a short entry for each day of the year. Each entry is a curation of quotes from Tolstoy\u0026rsquo;s readings and his own insights related to these quotes.\nHere is the entry for May 5.\nReligious teaching, that is, the explanation of the purpose and meaning of life, should be the basis of any education.\nPeople think that it is no crime to lie to children, and that to lie to children is not really very wrong, but even some­ times necessary. But it is clear that with children you should be especially careful and honest about what you say to them.\nYou should always be truthful, especially with a child. You should always do what you have promised him, otherwise you will teach him to lie.\n—After the Talmud\nMan, whose teacher is nature, should not be a piece of wax on which an elevated image of some professor is to be carved.\n—George Lichtenberg\nDo not say to a child whom you teach that there is a final truth, if you do not believe in something completely, or if you have some doubts. To do such a thing is a great crime.\nAfter I read the entry, we free-wrote for ten minutes about anything that jumped to us from the text. Ten minutes is short for journaling, so our entries were also short. But we were surprised by the depth of the insights that came to us, both of which we admitted arrived to us for the first time.\nHere is my entry:\nWhen I was younger, I used to think I was very original. I gave primacy to originality. When I went to college, in particular, I think I followed a path that really forced me to obey and conform. It was almost a violent change. The University of the Philippines education was violent in some way, but so was the education I had at the Kingdom Hall.\nAfter I left the religion, I became addicted to following someone else\u0026rsquo;s path. My voracious reading reflects this. It was my way of finding a safer path to walk on. I pride myself on being non-conforming, but really, it was so difficult to be original. Until now, I have felt this. To use George Lichtenberg\u0026rsquo;s analogy, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m still a \u0026ldquo;wax on which an elevated image of some professor is to be carved.\u0026rdquo;\nI would like to believe that my incessant and earnest efforts to listen to myself without the aid of long sentences and paragraphs and books was and is the beginning of my healing, a process that hopefully would not necessarily make me more original, but more authentic and true and honest to who I really am and move and build a life out of that knowing. That might also be how I become more original.\nAnd here is Lea\u0026rsquo;s entry:\nI think first of all, children, despite how young they are fully expressed human beings. Sure, they come to this earth to learn, but we have just as much to learn from them. It is always believed that children are brutally honest. That is because they say exactly what is on their mind. They have no concept, unless learned, about right or wrong, true or false. Kind of reminds me of the Trisolarians in the Three-Body Problem. Anyway, I do believe that we should not lie to children. Their youth is in their most vulnerable state, which triggers me because, looking back, I now realize how much l\u0026rsquo;ve been lied to and how the people in my life didn\u0026rsquo;t even know they were lying to me. I must have had doubts as well in my youth, but I was easily scared by threats of \u0026ldquo;hell,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Satan the Devil,\u0026rdquo; etc. Perhaps this is why it was always an instruction? to start preaching the \u0026ldquo;Gospel\u0026rdquo; to the young ones. Start while young.\nRight now, just thinking about it. It is such a cruel, twisted, evil thing. To manipulate an innocent mind and populate it with so much guilt, shame, and self-hate. Doubt enough to make him/her believe that she/he is evil. Done for. A goner. Going to hell. Punished. And for what?\nWe read each of these entries aloud to each other. Following advice from [[pat schneider|Pat Schneider]] about reacting to vulnerable pieces that have just been born, we responded by sharing what we liked about the other\u0026rsquo;s entry or what jumped to us from it. Only after reading what we wrote were we able to really have an honest and free conversation, a considerable part of which happened on our walk back home.\nOne of the things that surprised both of us from our conversation was how deep Lea\u0026rsquo;s hurt is from her religious upbringing, a conclusion she hadn\u0026rsquo;t reached before our little walk. I know that she would sometimes read Reddit threads and listen to podcasts about ex-Christians. Still, we both seemed to silently agree that, given the complexity of my religious past, my breakaway from traditional religion was more painful than hers, which only really started when she left home to live with me less than two years ago.\nWe were both surprised that reading Tolstoy\u0026rsquo;s entry in the context of a walk would make her feel the heaviness of that past, which she still confronts once in a while when she visits her family. Intending to learn more about how we can work together to help her through this process, we agreed to keep the matter a subject for future conversations.\nThe structure (dare I say, liturgy) that we came up with on our little Sunday walk is as follows:\n~ 30 mins. walk 5 mins. meditation 5 mins. reading of prompt 10 mins. journaling session 10 mins. sharing of entries ~ 30 mins. free conversation + walk Lea and I hope to continue this practice together in the coming weeks and iterate the structure to adapt to our changing needs. For example, we could lengthen the meditation sometime or alternate responsibilities in choosing a prompt to use for journaling.\nI am sharing this to illustrate a point that is essential to make. As human beings, we have a shared need to confront existence regardless of our spiritual or philosophical states. But often, at least in the case of the Philippines, secular institutions like schools don\u0026rsquo;t have the structure for the cultivation of inner lives. Those of us interested in perennial questions are left at the mercy of the myriads of churches that require us to commit to a certain ready-made set of doctrines before we can benefit from community and practice.\nAs far as I am aware, there is no accessible group near me that could cater to my needs as a non-theist individual deeply committed to a spiritual, philosophical, and religious path. Since these structures are not given, we who need them must build them.\n","date":"12 May 2024","permalink":"/tlw/033/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"A Sunday Walk"},{"content":"Hello friend,\nThis is [[05 obsidian/tags/uman|Uman]], a monthly newsletter I try to keep. Its name means \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; in the language I grew up speaking, Pangasinan, which many believe is dying.\nYou are receiving this because you subscribed to it days or months ago as a bundle to my other newsletter, [[05 obsidian/tags/tlw|The Long Walk]]. Uman is a collage of changes I went through in the past month, primarily while thinking about and practicing spirituality, walking, writing, and photography.\nInspired by some newfound insights after attempting to articulate my personal writing poetics through an essay set to be published by an academic/literary journal, I spent most of April doing some more writing and, as a consequence, thinking about its place in the life I\u0026rsquo;m trying to build these days.\nThe writing I did was an attempt to collate more than three years\u0026rsquo; worth of text I\u0026rsquo;ve written about [[walking los banos|walking Los Baños]] into two essays (perhaps, finally, the beginning of a book?). To begin the collation, I had to extract pieces of text ([[tags/vignettes|vignettes]]) from longer essays and newsletters I\u0026rsquo;ve written in the past, including the six essays I wrote for [[rxg|Roots x Gravel]], the week-long walk of Los Baños I did last December 2023.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m most concerned about the writing meditation prompted by this month-long project. As readers of this newsletter would know, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to reincorporate certain aspects of my religious past as an ex-Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witness minister into my conversion toward a [[jiyu shukyo|free, creative spirituality]]—a project I\u0026rsquo;ve been avoiding for years.\nOne of the elements of religious life I most enjoyed in the past is \u0026ldquo;ministry\u0026rdquo;—a form of service that is mainly directed toward the \u0026ldquo;other\u0026rdquo; (i.e., non-believer) in an attempt to bring them closer to the fold. As a JW, I primarily ministered to people who were deaf or hard of hearing in Baguio City, a ministry that required me to walk miles, leading to my affinity for walking as a spiritual practice.\nMinistry, along with all other aspects of religious life, was lost after I left the JWs. What replaced it somehow was writing, something I did very little as a JW minister. Because of this, as I contemplate today the best way I might bring back a form of ministry in my life, I\u0026rsquo;m deeply thinking about writing\u0026rsquo;s role in a free, creative spirituality and, perhaps more importantly, what it means to treat it as a form of ministry.\nWriting as Performance #This has to be thought about because writing is not often viewed as a form of service. Like all other art forms, it usually co-exists with this inclination to perform, entertain, and draw an audience. Therefore, the predominant way of viewing writing is to immediately get out of one\u0026rsquo;s shell (i.e., from one\u0026rsquo;s journals and diaries) and aspire for publication, that is, to produce something for an audience. The goal inculcated to many a writer is that the more readers one has, the better.\nTo gain readers, one needs to perform in front of existing audiences, something publications and more famous writers have. The main activities of a writer working to increase an audience are, therefore, working on craft, producing work, sending them to publications, applying some for workshops, and sending some to contests in hopes of gaining awards. All of these get easier when one becomes part of the academe (i.e., studying or teaching in a university with a press). To be published, workshopped, awarded, and institutionalized means to become a better performer, which makes one more suitable for a larger audience. In the Philippines, where the readership is still not as large as in other countries, the quest to gain readers is nothing short of a real competition. In this competition, the published, workshopped, awarded, and institutionalized dominates, taking the largest piece of the audience pie. Because of scant readership, attempts to counteract this prevailing system through self-publication still have limited effects.\nThe Dark Side of Writing as Performance #Because of this prevailing nature of the writing life, it is very easy to be allured by the siren call of fame. Writing is a celebrity game. The only question is how famous you are. Without care, one could easily fall to \u0026ldquo;the dark side.\u0026rdquo; In the Philippines, in 2022, a nationwide contest for writings written in regional languages was hi-jacked by plagiarists willing to do anything to win the awards, including sending poems they ripped from the social media posts of a well-known Pangasinense poet. A few years before this, a certain writer from the Southern Philippines faked his credentials (i.e., publications, workshops, and awards) and fooled the Filipino literary community until his unraveling in what became a nationwide scandal.\nReacting to the plagiarism mentioned above, Joel Pablo Salud, a journalist turn spiritual writer, said this:\nPlagiarism is a sign of an even deeper malady: the craving to be famous. Writing is not about discovering fame. Writing is about discovering yourself. Within that cumbersome isolation of writing, what do you see?\nTwo Elements of Writing as Ministry #Joel\u0026rsquo;s question underscored what I\u0026rsquo;ve been contemplating about writing and its role in religious and spiritual life, especially when conceptualized as a form of ministry.\nIn my experience, there are two elements of ministry: self-fulfillment and service. First, a ministry has to feel good. Doing it should be rewarding in itself. It is nurturing to one\u0026rsquo;s own spiritual life. Second, ministry always serves a particular community. It improves the lives and spiritual well-being of a group.\nPursuing writing as a ticket to fame endangers one\u0026rsquo;s view of oneself and never serves anyone. If writing lies in a spectrum, and \u0026ldquo;writing as a celebrity game\u0026rdquo; is at one end, what is at the other end is \u0026ldquo;writing as therapy.\u0026rdquo; This is writing done only for the self, never meant to be shared with anyone. Some people, such as those who use writing to heal from trauma, need to stay in this form of writing for as long as they need. However, because of its exclusivity, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit the bill of writing as a ministry. For writing to be a ministry, it needs to lie midway between one\u0026rsquo;s desire to heal oneself and one\u0026rsquo;s desire to be read.\nPat Schneider #When thinking about writing as a form of ministry, I remember [[pat schneider|Pat Schneider]], who, although published, awarded, workshopped, and institutionalized, used all of these to reconstruct how writing is practiced to be both self-fulfilling and service-oriented.\nShe founded a writing method called the [[awa method|Amherst Writers and Artists (AWA) method]], detailed in her book [[writing alone and with others schneider|Writing Alone and With Others]], which follows the following five affirmations:\nEveryone has a strong, unique voice. Everyone is born with creative genius. Writing as an art form belongs to all people, regardless of economic class or education level. The teaching of craft can be done without damage to a writer’s original voice or artistic self-esteem. A writer is someone who writes. Following these affirmations, Schneider prescribed a writing practice that begins with protecting the voice of a budding writer, which is always in danger of being curtailed by the violent voices of criticism. Schneider believed that a writer (which everyone is) deserves a safe environment where their voice is given the chance to flourish. Throughout its history, the AWA method was used to give voice to historically underserved communities, such as incarcerated women or women living in low-income communities. Those who were helped by the method train to become facilitators who conduct writing workshops for groups who need their voices to be heard the most.\nFr. James Martin #I also remember Fr. James Martin, the Jesuit priest famous for his radical stance against the Catholic faith\u0026rsquo;s outdated discrimination of the LGBTQ faithful. In April, I spent an hour or so watching an interview he gave about writing as spiritual practice.\nFr. Martin\u0026rsquo;s writing practice fits the \u0026ldquo;writing as ministry\u0026rdquo; perfectly well. First, there is an intentional desire to keep the writing as fulfilling as possible in his practice. He describes his writing practice as happy and consoling. He says he doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel pressure when writing, and this is because he doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a living out of it. He also doesn\u0026rsquo;t see it as a career, nor is he writing for good reviews, promotion (as is the case with most academics), or sales. He writes what he wants in his own time, and no one assigns him his subjects (as with journalists). Because of this, his writing sessions are one of the most pleasurable times of his day.\nHowever, Fr. Martin\u0026rsquo;s writing practice is very much directed toward his readers, whom he calls \u0026ldquo;souls.\u0026rdquo; According to him, he wrote books primarily as a spiritual director who answered questions people asked him about spiritual life. He describes himself as a Jesuit priest who happens to write and says he writes to help souls and not to make art. Because of this poetics, he is compelled to write clearly rather than beautifully. Because his words need to serve others, he writes as transparently as possible, showing his struggles to illustrate to his readers that it is okay to struggle and that there is no need to be embarrassed about it. He said that one of the goals of writing as a form of ministry is to create an intimate bond with one\u0026rsquo;s reader through words. He draws inspiration from [[thomas merton|Thomas Merton]], another writing priest, who once said:\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know if I really became a true monk, or a true contemplative, but what I do know, is that I am a writer, that I was one before I entered the monastery. I\u0026rsquo;m still one, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to remain one.\u0026rdquo;\nRem Tanauan and Rofel Brion #Top-of-the-mind Filipino exemplars of writing as a ministry are [[rofel brion|Rofel Brion]] and [[rem tanauan|Rem Tanauan]], both of whom I know personally. The late Batangueño poet Rem Tanauan was a close friend who intentionally pursued a writing practice situated on the fringes of the Filipino literary community to keep it personally fulfilling and close to his own spiritual aspirations. He never attended school to receive formal training in writing. His only training was from a famous poetry organization in the country, a training he often cited as the reason why he quit writing for about five years before finding the courage to return to it again.\nHis intimate and spiritual relationship with writing didn\u0026rsquo;t prevent him from serving a community, though. When the whole world was forced to quarantine in 2020, Rem launched an intensive online course on poetry he called Tungko ng Tula (Tripod of Poetry). His first students were people like me who were coming to poetry for the first time and looking for spiritual comfort through writing in a time of isolation and fear. He continued teaching his course for three years, serving four batches, until he died in October 2022. Those touched by Rem\u0026rsquo;s words and \u0026ldquo;ministry\u0026rdquo; were too many we had to hold two long nights to accommodate those who wanted to speak in honor of his memory.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s Rofel Brion, of course, who himself is an institution in Filipino poetry. Unlike Rem, Rofel was well institutionalized, having been trained in writing in the country\u0026rsquo;s top schools. He is also published, awarded, workshopped, and well-connected to the literary community. It was surprising, therefore, to hear from him in a podcast interview he gave that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t take his writing seriously, and this somehow leads to his success. Most of his poems were written during the retreats he took. Reading his poems is like reading prayers. Many of his writings are also dedicated to specific people in his life: family, friends, and perhaps even the people he has guided. These people are his audience. Rofel is a teacher and a spiritual guide, and these roles take over his life more than the writing. The writing he does is an expression, an extension of his ministry.\nSo, I return to my question: How could I modify writing to become the kind of ministry I want to incorporate into the new free and creative spirituality I\u0026rsquo;m currently exploring?\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have complete and certain answers to this question, but based on the thinking, reflecting, and trying out I did in the past weeks, here are a few thoughts worth considering.\nPerhaps, I could decrease the time I spend on producing works meant for publications, contests, and workshop applications. Unchecked, these could easily take all of a writer\u0026rsquo;s time. To explore a more ministerial form of writing, I need to make enough time for it. Perhaps, I should also put aside an initial plan I had to pursue graduate studies in creative writing. I have no doubt that graduate studies would help me improve my craft. What I\u0026rsquo;m unsure of is whether it would help me nurture a fulfilling relationship with writing and encourage me to see it as an act of service more than an art form. The time I save from letting go of pursuing publication, contests, workshops, and additional schooling might be better spent understanding who it is I want to serve, finding them, connecting with them, engaging them, and understanding what they need. By deeply understanding the needs of my ideal reader, I could shape a writing practice dedicated to providing works that could potentially make a difference in their lives. In addition to all these, I could invest more time in making sure that my writing sessions remain fun and fulfilling. This could include spending more time on forms of writing I know I already enjoy, such as [[journaling]], note writing in my [[talahardin]], and writing field notes while walking. These forms of writing are all experiments on the [[draft]], a writing form that escapes publication, awards, workshops, and even serious study, but are form that is intimately embedded in the religious and spiritual life. While far from being conclusive, these are concrete and actionable steps I could take in the coming days.\nWhat do you think of them?\n","date":"1 May 2024","permalink":"/uman/018/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 018 — April 2024"},{"content":"March was a month mostly of writing and rewriting and contemplating about writing. Some things did happen outside the letters and symbols on my journal and blinking cursors on my screen. But mostly, it was really just writing.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another collage of what has been an ordinary yet instructive month.\nBuhian Essay #An essay I submitted to the upcoming Buhian edition of the Filipino journal Katipunan passed the initial screening and was returned to me for considerable revisions. I spent about two weeks working on the second draft (which doubled the essay length!), but, in the end, I was pleased with the result. Revising the essay helped me understand my own poetics and how it weaves beautifully with my spiritual stance, that is, [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]]. Doing so has been profoundly revealing, not because it clarified many things but because it opened up more questions to explore.\nThe essay, which might come out this April 2024, was about my walking and writing practice and the tools and system I use to execute it. It contains the first articulation of my philosophy of writing (which I am only now truly understanding) and its material manifestation, which I call the talahardin, or \u0026ldquo;garden of notes.\u0026rdquo; The essay was written in Filipino, but I plan to release an English translation here in the newsletter if the editors permit me.\nAmong the things I enjoyed the most while revising were writing a short history of walking in the Philippines, reading the thesis [[authoring autonomy cruz|Authoring Autonomy by Conchitina Cruz]], browsing the literary folio [[sandugo|Sandugo]] (a collection of poems and essays written in tribute to the three thousand indigenous peoples who walked from all over the Philippines to Manila in 2016 as a form of protest), learning about the songs of the Ikalahan, writing about the [[dagli]], and contextualizing the [[talahardin]] in the current electronic media used in writing and reading in the Philippines.\nMore Writing #Because of the revisions I made to the essay mentioned above and other freelance writing projects, I didn\u0026rsquo;t publish that much in the newsletter this month. After sending the [[uman 2024-02|February issue of Uman]], I could only send a short update about the page I recently created on the website, which I hope would be the most comprehensive resource on [[walking the philippines|walking the Philippines]]. That said, a draft of a [[burning fields|poem]] did come to me one night in the middle of my sleep. I woke up with the words floating over my head. It was a poem about the house I grew up in at Pangasinan, which is now in complete disarray after we all left it in 2021. I might visit the house this month to take photos and perhaps write something about it.\nSpeaking of Pangasinan, one of the few writers in my first language, Santiago Villafania, died this March at 53. He was masterful in his handle of the language and successful in putting Pangasinan literature into the Filipino literary scene, a courageous feat given the limited readership in this language. His death has affected many of us who speak the language and are trying our best to write in it despite the challenges.\nIn honor of him, I read one of his poems and shared the reading on social media. Here\u0026rsquo;s the poem and my rough English translation of it:\nsonito 129 #natan ta naandi ka la bilay\nduma la\u0026rsquo;y pakanengneng ed mundo\naliwa lan malinak so labin\npitutuyawan ko ed ilalam\nsaray kantikanti \u0026lsquo;ran bitewen\nagla \u0026lsquo;ra makaleksab ed dalin\ntinundaan da met lan aligen\nso kirlap tan yumis da\u0026rsquo;ra\u0026rsquo;y matam\nanggapo la\u0026rsquo;y hambayo ed dagem\ntan saray un-uni na anuyiao\na sipur iran manko-concierto\nno bansagan da so awawey mo\nagla mangaanlong ira\u0026rsquo;y musiak\nKatawan! inatey ak la amo?\nsonnet 129 #now that you are gone, life\nthe world now looks different\nthe night where my thoughts\ntake their rest has lost its calm\nthe stars that shine bright\nno longer come to earth\nthey\u0026rsquo;ve stopped to imitate\nthe glitter and clarity of your eyes\nthere is no more comfort in the air\nno more songs of the sparrows\nthat naturally sing when they join\nthe dances of your mind\nno more poems from my muses\nLord! am I dead?\nWalking Binondo, Walking Flat Rocks # I managed to do some walking this month. A few days before Lent, I walked with some friends to the nearby Flat Rocks along the Mt. Makiling trail. It was my first time visiting the rocks, so I was looking forward to it. We stood, sat, and lay down on these rocks, proof of the mountain\u0026rsquo;s volcanic past. We stayed atop those rocks for around two hours, a much-needed forest bath.\nEarlier this month, I also walked Binondo, the world\u0026rsquo;s oldest Chinatown. Located at the heart of Metro Manila, Binondo is home not only to famous Chinese restaurants but also to traces of the American architectural imperialist project. Here is a complex representation of the Philippines: an almost unrecognizable Frankenstein-like monster made up of patches of the old and the new. Here is a Chinatown in the middle of a Spanish plaza complex, surrounded by American buildings, bridges, and streets. While walking, I was constantly asking myself: Where is the Filipino? The answer, of course, is that it is everywhere. The amalgamation is the Filipino.\nMindful March, Rice is Life #This March, I attended three one-hour sessions of Louise Far\u0026rsquo;s Mindful March Contemplative Photography Workshop. I\u0026rsquo;ve always seen photography as a rest from writing, and with too much writing happening in March, Louise\u0026rsquo;s sessions were a much-needed break.\nI really enjoyed the last session, when we were prompted to take a photo of our hand. Since I am right-handed, I took a picture of my left hand, which was tricky when using a DSLR. The process moved me because I realized I\u0026rsquo;d never looked at my hand as close before, and doing so, especially in dim light, revealing new emotions.\nUsing what I learned from Louise\u0026rsquo;s workshop, I volunteered to photograph a community cooking event organized by some of my friends in my locality. The event was a tribute to rice, the staple food of most Filipinos, which is unfortunately mired by violence on many levels of society. We cooked four different rice meals, talked about the complex social issues revolving around the plant, and shared poetry about rice.\nHere are some photos I took of the event.\nSummer has begun in this part of the world. While heat indices in different parts of the country have skyrocketed, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that Los Baños, given its proximity to a mountain and a large lake, has its mini weather system that somehow counteracts the heat. Our evenings, early evenings, and late afternoons are still relatively cold.\nApril is here, and with it comes more opportunities for walking, writing, contemplation, and being around people we love. I wish you a fruitful month wherever you are in the world.\nThank you for being here.\n","date":"1 April 2024","permalink":"/uman/017/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 017 — March 2024"},{"content":" Friends!\nThis is still Vince Imbat, writer of this newsletter.\nThis will be a short one, an update of sorts.\nI recently created a page on my website that I hope would be the most comprehensive page on walking the Philippines.

If you are someone who fits the bill or knows anyone whose work deserves to be included on the page, please let me know.\nI hope three sections will be helpful for those of you interested in learning more about walking in the Philippines: the literature on walking in the Philippines, sources for a history of walking in the Philippines, and walking arts in the Philippines.\nCurrently, there is no walking arts movement in the country. That\u0026rsquo;s okay because, as Phil Smith argued in one of his essays, the existence of a walking arts movement in the world is questionable. In the Philippines, we currently have a few literary works written using walking and a few contemporary artists experimenting with walking, who are disconnected from one another.

But there is more to be done.\nPositionlessness #While walking one night early in February, I was moved to write the following words on my phone:\nThe reason why you were passionate as a JW pastor was that you really deeply believed in your position.\nI then asked myself:\nDo you truly believe in whatever you believe now to be passionate about it?\nOne of the things that made my life easy as a Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witness (JW) was that there was no ambiguity about things I knew I had to avoid (e.g., cigarettes, blood transfusion, sex outside marriage, etc.) and things I had to go toward (e.g., more hours devoted to preaching, personal Bible study, attending meetings, etc.). While inside that ready-made religion, the beliefs I was expected to uphold were clearly articulated. I heard them twice weekly at the Kingdom Hall and read them daily in the publications. As a member of a century-old international religious organization, I enjoyed a clarity of vision that made me feel comfortable, safe, and secure. The path was laid out in front of me. All I had to do was walk it and follow all those who came before me.\nAs a child, I used to hear the precautionary story about the Israelites, who, en route to the promised land after being saved from Egypt, had to wander around the wilderness for 40 years after disobeying Jehovah. At the Kingdom Hall, the elders used the stark contrast between the experience of walking in the wilderness and living in the promised land to emphasize the difference between being part of the organization and leaving it.\nThey were right. Living outside of organized religion has been a wilderness experience, at least for me. Most days, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m just walking with no particular destination. In the past 12 years, I\u0026rsquo;ve been mostly alone in this spiritual wilderness. Here, there is no clarity of vision. If there were any hopes for a clear destination, these were all short-lived. The spiritual wilderness is in constant flux.\nAnd so, to answer my own question: Do I truly believe in whatever I believe now to be passionate about it? My answer would be an easy \u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; The path I found myself on after leaving the solid walls of organized religion is a path where belief—latching on to an idea—is less valuable than openness. Of course, others would have a different experience, but I\u0026rsquo;m not the only person who has reached this conclusion.\nMy intellectual history from 2012 to 2024 was filled with faux beliefs. Eager to latch into the next big thing, I engaged in a pattern of committing myself to ideas and belief systems only to find myself questioning them later. Atheism, humanism, socialism, Hinduism, Advaita Vedanta, Zen Buddhism, environmentalism, Stoicism, and more—at various points along the way, I was convinced that each of these isms was my quest—the big thing that would explain my entire life and fill the giant hole left by Jehovah. But every time I committed to one, I would later leave. This happened many times that, around 2021, I knew I was already exhausted, and perhaps it was the reason why I started entertaining the idea of returning to my religious past and finding things I could incorporate into my current life.\nEver since contemplating incorporation, I started entertaining the idea that perhaps it isn\u0026rsquo;t belief that I should aspire to but openness. Each moment in my life occurs as something new, a miracle that only reveals itself at this moment. To use a single \u0026ldquo;ism\u0026rdquo; to respond to each moment is doomed to fail. So, instead of seeing this lack of strong beliefs and my tendency to ascribe to weak thought as a liability, I may begin seeing it not only as my new normal but also as an asset. In Paul Wienpahl\u0026rsquo;s (1916–1980) words, it might be helpful to begin seeing myself as a \u0026ldquo;man without a position.\u0026rdquo;\nThis \u0026ldquo;positionlessness\u0026rdquo; is, of course, still a position. A danger inherent in it is that it might encourage someone not to take a stand when necessary. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be the case. Positionlessness doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to mean not taking any position at all. Letting go of a single position means I open myself to more positions. Therefore, positionlessness is positionfulness in disguise. Being a man (or a woman) without a position means rejecting the imposition that one should never change. This is, of course, a position—one that a man without a position constantly takes.\nTo illustrate positionlessnes, think photography. I love this illustration offered by [[andrew j brown]]:\nI always try to pick up my camera and go out into the world without a ready-made, fully worked-out blueprint, theory or plan about how, when or where to take a photograph. In this sense, what the surfboard is to the surfer, the camera is to me the photographer. In doing this I’m attempting to keep myself open to whatever whooshes-up or shines before me, whether that is in the form of an obvious “subject”, “view”, or a simple passing play of sunlight and shadow. When something does whoosh-up or shines before me, I stop and take a photograph. To do this I must, of course, temporarily “take a position.” Not only by standing still in this or that place but also by taking a position with regard to the camera settings I am going to use, the f-stop, the shutter speed, film speed and whether to shoot in black and white or colour. Now, were I never to take this or that position with regard to all these things, I would never be able to take any photo (good or bad). However, it is vitally important that, having taken a photograph, I never become wholly wedded to this or that particular position, subject, view, passing play of sunlight and shadow or this or that set of settings—instead, I must move on, intra-actively, on the crest of the unfolding world, to attain another perspective and so allow something else to whoosh-up or shine before me which calls me to shoot, click!\nWalking is also a good illustration of positionlessness. The main point is that in a state where one rejects the need to take a stand and stay there as long as one can, one recognizes that a position at any given time will always provide an incomplete image of its subject. Walking (or any form of movement) allows one to see other angles that, although it will not complete one\u0026rsquo;s vision, will provide a better picture and understanding of a subject.\nCharles Olson and Incorporating Ministry #One of the things that worked for me in my religious past was that I had a ministry: I learned sign language and taught the Bible to people who were deaf or hard of hearing—something like [[shinichiro imaoka|Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s]] ikigai or [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s]] quest.\nA result of not having strong beliefs is that having something with the shape of ministry is not a given. As I latched into ideologies and left them, so did my sense of purpose. I may not need belief in the spiritual wilderness, but I do need some sense of direction. And this is why I think I resonated very much after reading about [[charles olson|Charles Olson]] via Andrew James Brown. In the article The Freedom to Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today, Andrew wrote about Olson:\nOlson tells us that the work of the morning “is methodology: how to use oneself, and on what\u0026quot;\nIndeed, how can I use myself, and on what?\nAs a JW minister, my dream was to be a missionary, which involved working directly with people and tangibly seeing the effect of my work. However, after my depression and leaving the JWs, I noticed I became more invested in more solitary activities like writing, studying, and photography. These helped in my healing. But I\u0026rsquo;m now feeling an itch to get out there and do something that puts me in more direct contact with people I want to help. How can I experience \u0026ldquo;ministering\u0026rdquo; to others directly in a free, creative spirituality?\nThrough Andrew James Brown\u0026rsquo;s help, I unpacked this question. The first thing to do was to question the idea of \u0026ldquo;ministry\u0026rdquo; itself. In a free, creative spirituality, the idea of having one person minister to a group will have to be dropped. Instead, each group member should be seen as a minister, and the ministry should be spread out rather than concentrated on one person or a few. Since everyone relies on everyone, it is even more critical to ask oneself, what is my methodology? How can I be of use to others?\nWriting as Ministry #As religious activities slowly left me, I noticed myself leaning more and more toward writing. Given the circumstances, it was inevitable that most of my writing experience was inward and solitary. One thing I\u0026rsquo;m considering now is making this outward. One option is to facilitate writing in the tradition of the Amherst Writers and Artists (AWA) method, a tradition laid out in the founder Pat Schneider\u0026rsquo;s book [[writing alone and with others schneider|Writing Alone and With Others]]. I could use the AWA method to facilitate writing workshops for people like me who are going through spiritual and religious ambiguity. But how about the act of writing itself? How could it be a form of ministry?\nIn answering this question, it is helpful to return to Olson. Andrew said:\nHe [Olson] wants us to create things where the form they take perfectly, and immediately, expresses the content; where our poetry, music, acts of social justice and worship, are the fullest possible expressions of ourselves and not merely inauthentic, arty or moralistic clothing.\nFor writing to be a form of ministry, it has to stop being simply an aesthetic practice used only to express ourselves beautifully. Instead, it has to attempt to be \u0026ldquo;the fullest possible expressions of ourselves.\u0026rdquo; Any project with such a goal involves showing even what is ugly.\nThinking about this statement by Olson, I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of two things I\u0026rsquo;ve read some time ago. First is the conclusion Lawrence Buell reached after studying the American transcendentalists\u0026rsquo; literary method. In his book [[literary transcendentalism buell|Literary Transcendentalism]], Buell concluded that the transcendentalists theorized writing not simply as a tool to express the creative genius they believed resided within every human being but also to serve as a tool to strengthen an ethical life unique to each of them (something like [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]]). This two-pronged purpose of writing informed their choices of form—the lecture, the sermon, the manifesto-note, the reverie, and the poem.\nI also remember a paragraph I read from James Klagge\u0026rsquo;s Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s Artillery: Philosophy as Poetry (2021).\nWallace Stevens, in “Of Modern Poetry” (1940), defines a poem as “the mind in the act of finding / What will suffice.” This seems to me to be true of any work organized lyrically: poems, certain sorts of essays, certain sorts of fiction. We see in such work a mind moving—noting and considering, listening to what it has just said, leaping forward or turning back. Rather than reporting on what will suffice, speaking from a position of arrival, this kind of writing dramatizes the act of getting there. What we do when we read such work, as Kenneth Burke illustrates …, is reenact that movement. We perform the poem, connecting image to image or turn to turn, making of its various parts a coherent inner action: “For a poem is an act, the symbolic act of the poet who made it—an act of such a nature that, in surviving as a structure or an affect, it enables us as readers to re-enact it.”\nThe problem with reading a beautiful piece of writing is that it is often too beautiful to trace where it came from. If writing is used as a form of ministry, it has to let go of aesthetics when it needs to be honest. It has to show where it came from, what twists and turns it took to get here, what dead-ends it reached, and how it got back so that we can see a mind unsure yet moving. A writing ministry favors honesty over beauty because it is through honesty that we can truly minister to the other person.\nWalking as Ministry #This leads us to walking\u0026rsquo;s role in writing and the form of ministry that I could incorporate into my current writing life. Walking intentionally favors the messy. When one walks, it is only natural to have flights of thought as feet interact with matter, and matter affects the mind\u0026rsquo;s current state. Unsurprisingly, walking as a writing methodology is often associated with writing techniques like [[streams of consciousness|streams of consciousness]].\nAndrew suggested that I explore the works of [[phil smith|Phil Smith]], a performance-maker and academic who advocates a particular form of \u0026ldquo;radical walking\u0026rdquo; based on the twentieth-century [[derive]]. According to Phil Smith, radical walking emerged from anti-capitalist post-war European activists who rejected Stalinism in favor of \u0026ldquo;a Marcusean liberation of subjectivity, eros, desire, and exploration of irrational zones of consciousness, beyond the reach of mass media.\u0026rdquo; Despite its strong sense of subjectivity, practitioners of the derive aspired to build communities around the walking they did.\nIn an essay in 2021 entitled [[that which walks smith|That Which Walks]], Smith delineated a history of the walking arts in Europe (while walking artists exist worldwide, the craft is still heavily European). According to him, in the years before 2008, radical walkers were united in their \u0026ldquo;resistance against romanticist walking\u0026rdquo; that favored individualism. After 2008, finding a pattern among walking artists wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy. He blames the lack of innovation within radical walking itself, which manifested in a lack of theories and practices. As the original focus of radical walking disintegrated, groups that became interested in the walking arts created their own theories and practices based on their own varied purposes. To make matters worse, very little documentation and communication among these groups happened. What developed was a highly open and diverse walking arts that embraced individualism, autonomy, and subjectivity (like the romantic walkers did) rather than collectivism.\nMoving forward, Smith believes that the derive could return to its original collectivist aspirations by embracing the concrete materiality of the nonhuman. In a 2019 conference of walking artists in Plymouth, he detected and reported this tendency.\nThis history is fascinating because somehow, the history of the derive, as Smith describes it, mirrors the kind of jiyū shūkyō expressed by Shinichiro Imaoka in his [[imaoka principles of living|Creed of Life]]. In eight affirmations, Imaoka moved from recognizing a person\u0026rsquo;s unique individuality to affirming that such individuality could only be nurtured in the context of a community and later moved to include the nonhuman world in that community. Here, I think, lies the key to seeing how I could use walking as a form of jiyū shūkyō ministry.\nI plan to go deeper into Phil Smith\u0026rsquo;s work, the contemporary derive, and other forms of radical walking in the Philippines. I\u0026rsquo;ll see where this research brings me. My primary intention is to produce walking-inspired written artifacts and design walking experiences that could help people explore jiyū shūkyō.\nKiitsu Kyōkai #This February, I also attended my first kiitsu kyōkai meetings. They\u0026rsquo;re an hour and a half long meetings comprising [[seiza]] meditation followed by free conversation. Facilitated by Andrew James Brown, they\u0026rsquo;re the sort of meetings that encourage the kind of jiyū shūkyō I\u0026rsquo;m currently exploring and writing about here. I attend the sessions on the second and fourth Thursdays of the month because they are friendlier to Philippine time, but another schedule is available. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested, check out the kiitsu kyōkai website for more information.\nWebsite Improvement #Finally, I spent the last few days of February improving this website. Given the recent changes in my focus of interest, it is only appropriate to update the site\u0026rsquo;s homepage and the about page. I also made the newsletters page more helpful. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet, please visit them using the links below.\n[[_index|Home]] [[about|About]] [[newsletters|Newsletters]] I also added a navigation menu to help you find what you\u0026rsquo;re looking for faster. Lastly, I\u0026rsquo;m experimenting with a new newsletter application called Listmonk. It\u0026rsquo;s an open-source application, which means it\u0026rsquo;s free and its code can be tweaked. Listmonk gives me more freedom to design the emails I send you. Making the switch also allows me to direct your attention to my website rather than my Substack archives. It\u0026rsquo;s still an experiment though, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see where it goes.\nOn that note, I\u0026rsquo;ll end February\u0026rsquo;s Uman here.\nMay your March be as always free.\n","date":"1 March 2024","permalink":"/uman/016/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 016 — February 2024"},{"content":"Sitting there on that tiny chair\nacross her, I babbled words\nlike a platoon commander,\nher eyes teary on both ends.\nI felt the need to stop\nbut my chest won\u0026rsquo;t let me\nand my mouth went on\nand on until both had had enough,\nuntil both had me raise my head\nto stare at the ceiling briefly\nbefore I shut my eyes close\nto stay there in that darkness\nfor as long as I can\nand muddle on that silence\nthat I knew she needed,\nthat I most definitely needed,\na lull that stopped me\nfrom barricading myself\ninside a wall of words,\na concrete cage of callousness.\n","date":"11 February 2024","permalink":"/tlw/030/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Prayer"},{"content":"Each shadow\nshortens\nall morning long\nuntil it vanishes\ninto the small dent of noon\nand the builders of shadows pause.\n— Gary Whited, \u0026ldquo;Shadow Builders\u0026rdquo;\nWelcome to 2024\u0026rsquo;s first issue of Uman, a word that means \u0026ldquo;change\u0026rdquo; and which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using to collate ideas, verses, images, and conversations in the past 30 days. Writing this \u0026ldquo;report\u0026rdquo; helps me keep track of any progress I make in this long walk of mine, a sort of written photograph of my intellectual and aesthetic footprints. I\u0026rsquo;m still unsure whether this is of any value to you (can you let me know if it does?). At the very least, I hope it could be a lovely quick weekend reading for you.\nLooking Back #On the first week of January 2024, I took some time to write [[uman 2023-12|the final issue of Uman for 2023]]. I also paused to look back at the year that just passed. This annual review has been a tradition I\u0026rsquo;ve kept for more than a decade, and it has helped me articulate the most important things to prioritize in the year ahead. After publishing my [[2023 annual review|2023 annual review]], I knew authenticity and focus were my main themes for 2024.\nWalking Baguio #After finishing my annual review, I immediately shifted my attention to preparing for my [[tall tales 1|week-long walk of Baguio]] from January 15 to 21. To consult about the design of the walk, I called [[louise far|Louise Far]]. The first question she asked me was, \u0026ldquo;How will you protect yourself while doing it?\u0026rdquo; The question caught me by surprise. I knew the walk could be triggering, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t consider this in my initial design.\nMy consultation with Louise convinced me to refocus the project from merely remembering to also returning and reimagining the places I\u0026rsquo;m revisiting. As I articulated in the [[baguio walk 1|introduction]] to the walk, I decided to treat each walk like a meditation anchored in the present moment, which served as a refuge to potentially triggering memories and emotions.\nI did three walks and sent five missives, including the closing essay.\n[[tall tales day 1|Day 01 — Firsts]] [[tall tales day 2|Day 02 — Families]] [[tall tales day 3|Day 03 — A Walking Kissa]] [[tall tales day 4|Day 04 — Night]] [[tall tales end|The End (For Now)]] I learned a lot about myself and my relationship with my religious past from these walks. The walks made me realize that I\u0026rsquo;m sincerely curious about what happened to the friends I left in the church and that I welcome any possible future encounters with them—encounters where I hope to be my most authentic self. The walks also strengthened my resolve to understand how I can best hold space for my neighbor, no matter how different their beliefs are from me.\nTherapeutic Journey for the Free Spirit #At the end of the Baguio walk, I spent about a week with my parents at Pangasinan. While there, I re-read [[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown\u0026rsquo;s]] article \u0026ldquo;The Freedom to Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today, which contained a section about [[friedrich nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s]] four-phased journey for the free spirit. Andrew told me it might help me think about the Baguio walk. I also read the first chapter of Gordon Bearn\u0026rsquo;s book Waking to Wonder (1997), entitled [[superficial out of profundity bearn|\u0026ldquo;Superficial—Out of Profundity,\u0026rdquo;]] which provided an enlightening description of the journey.\nReading these two texts helped me understand that I\u0026rsquo;m still healing from leaving the JWs. To finish my healing process, I must recognize the things that brought warmth to me in my past life that I could still incorporate in my present life, albeit differently—things like faith, prayer, and ministry. Reading about the framework helped me understand that returning to places from my past brought out emotions that inform where I am in my healing journey and that walking to these places facilitates this process of incorporation.\nI realized that engaging with existence makes me feel warm, i.e., seeing how ordinary objects and events are portals to existential questions and emotions. Nietzsche helped me visualize a thriving life entirely outside the metaphysical tradition I inherited—a life where I see things as they are, as if for the first time, fragile and transient, and, therefore, precious and near. I wrote an essay ([[where the sun warms|\u0026ldquo;Where the Sun Warms\u0026rdquo;]]) to summarize my insights from reading about the framework.\nA few days before I left Pangasinan to return to Los Baños, I had dinner with my parents, my sister, her husband, and her husband\u0026rsquo;s sister, who was visiting from Palawan. All of them were in the faith. While it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the first time I\u0026rsquo;d broken bread with this group, the dinner had a different flavor, given my recent reading of Nietzsche.\nAfter hearing my brother-in-law say the prayer (which I listened to closely), I began asking questions to the group, questions that didn\u0026rsquo;t avoid talking about their faith. I asked about friends I once had in the church, particularly the old ones, hoping most were still alive. I asked my sister and her husband how their friends in their congregations helped them in their wedding. I jokingly asked our guest from Palawan whether she had found any pleasing gentleman in the congregations she visited in the north. And then, when I felt like I needed to give them space to talk about the assembly they attended in the morning, I stood up and volunteered to do the dishes, listening to them nearby speak about people whose names I no longer recognize and subjects I no longer remember.\nThe night went just fine. After seeing them off that night, I took a quick walk toward a nearby field, dried and cold as it is at this time of the year. I could hear the sound of a water pump nearby as I raised my head toward the sky adorned by Jupiter, Saturn, and the constellations. I stared there for a while.\nHealing isn\u0026rsquo;t done yet. But the warmth I feel inside has been staying here longer—longer, even in the middle of days cold as these.\n","date":"2 February 2024","permalink":"/uman/015/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 015 — January 2024"},{"content":" In 1886, in a new preface he wrote for his book Human, All-Too-Human: A Book for Free Spirits, [[friedrich nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]] detailed a four-phased journey that an individual takes to become a \u0026ldquo;free spirit.\u0026rdquo; Gordon Bearn called these phases: hearth health, sickness, convalescence, and the great health of the free spirit.1 As the labels suggest, the journey describes a path to recovery from an illness.\n[[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown]]2 directed my attention to this four-phased journey during my [[tags/tall tales 1|re-walk]] of Baguio last January 15–21, 2024. On the first day of that week-long walk, I returned to the kingdom hall at Rimando Road, the center of my activities as a Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witness (JW) minister fourteen years ago.\nAs I stood there staring at an entirely new building, the old wooden one destroyed and replaced by a new concrete structure, I felt like a voyeur staring at something I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t look at. There, I started questioning my motivations for returning. I began to have doubts about the purpose of the entire project.3\nIn the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve written about how [[traversing liminality through walking|walking can help us begin a conversation between our past and present selves]], helping us traverse a space of uncertainty—of [[liminality]]. What I still haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out is where this desire to traverse liminality emerges in the first place.\nWhy is there an urge to return to places and memories we\u0026rsquo;ve left behind? After reading about Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s four-phased journey for the free spirit, I think I have a working answer to my own question.\nHearth Health #The free spirit begins his journey in a state of health, a health he acquires from being near the hearth (fireplace). In Filipino culture, the hearth is reminiscent of dapog, a stove made of mud that stands on three legs (tungko) and burns through firewood. The dapog is where the food that nurtures the family comes from and, therefore, represents everything that keeps us healthy. The hearth also reminds me of the fire in the middle of a dap-ay, a gathering place for elders in many indigenous groups around the Philippines, a symbol of tradition handed down to us for generations.\nWhile the hearth provides health—a sense of purpose and security—for the free spirit in this first phase of his journey, Nietzsche says that he isn\u0026rsquo;t truly \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; around it. In fact, Nietzsche says that a free spirit\u0026rsquo;s peak moments while being around the hearth \u0026ldquo;fetter them the fastest, lay upon them the most enduring obligations.\u0026rdquo; The hearth, therefore, is bondage.\nBearn says that the hearth symbolizes our inherited traditions, and our desire to be around the fire represents our \u0026ldquo;dutiful reverence\u0026rdquo; for our elders, country, and teachers. In religious terms, the hearth is the religious tradition we inherited.\nIn my story, this phase coincides with the period from when I was born and raised in a JW household until the year I became a ministerial servant (1992–2011). This is the first two decades of my life.\nSickness #Nietzsche then pronounces that a sickness befalls the free spirit, a sickness that suddenly takes him away from the hearth. The illness begins with a suspicion that the things that once gave purpose and security to him are, in fact, false. This suspicion later aggravates as hatred for everything that he once loved.\nAs the illness progresses, she begins to consider that the things she once held \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; are, in fact, \u0026ldquo;good.\u0026rdquo; At its worst, nihilism envelopes the sick. He begins to believe that nothing matters, neither what was once good nor what was once evil. These were, of course, caused by the crumbling of the hearth.\nIn religious terms, the sickness of nihilism results from losing one\u0026rsquo;s inherited religious tradition, which once explained the chaos inherent in the universe and provided purpose to one\u0026rsquo;s life. Without it, the meaning of life is lost.\nIn my story, this period of sickness began with my depressive episode in 2011. The suffering it caused triggered my suspicion that the Bible isn\u0026rsquo;t the word of God and that the authority of the elders in my religion, which they claim comes from God, is a lie. Later, I questioned the very existence of a lawgiver in heaven.\nThe suspicion transformed into a hatred of things I once loved, which culminated in my abandonment of the religion in 2012. Throughout this time, I was predominantly nihilistic. After the drugs kicked in, my first insight from the depressive experience was that \u0026ldquo;the universe was inherently meaningless.\u0026rdquo;\nConvalescence #Sickness is followed by \u0026ldquo;long years of convalescence\u0026rdquo; in two phases. A cold detachment from the world characterizes the first phase of convalescence.\nThe metaphor Nietzsche uses here is one of a soaring bird high above the sky. Still recovering from nihilism, the free spirit continues to be skeptical of almost everything. He neither loves nor hates things but sees them through a theoretical or scholarly gaze. At this point, the free spirit is already significantly distant from the hearth that none of the things there already matter, and the intense hatred he once felt toward the hearth during his sickness was now tempered.\nIn this cold and distant phase, the free spirit is still partial to the idea that nothing matters, but he isn\u0026rsquo;t too worried about it. Enjoying his newfound freedom away from everything else, he begins to smile.\nIn my story, recovery from nihilism began when I decided to take hold of my life after depression. Recognizing that blaming my parents for what happened and spending my days inside my room, watching movie after movie while gaining weight, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take me anywhere, I decided to return to school in the first semester of 2012 to finish my college degree. It was also at this time that I chose to leave the JWs.\nWhile finishing my studies from 2012 to 2014, I dipped my toes in atheism and humanism and maintained a detached, scholarly approach to life. I lived mostly inside my head, studying theory after theory, trying to justify my decision to leave the heath. Joining a political organization in school did help me connect with the real world and have some purpose. But those two years were the least spiritual years of my life.\nBut then, the free spirit realizes that soaring like a bird above all else will not complete his recovery. While flying away from the world below him, he begins to feel the coldness of a detached and stoic existence. He starts to notice a growing desire to feel the warmth of lower altitudes, of the ground, \u0026ldquo;where the sun warms.\u0026rdquo;\nAs the free spirit makes his descent, Nietzsche describes what he experiences:\nIt again grows warmer around him, yellower, as it were; feeling and feeling for others acquire depth, warm breezes of all kinds blow across him. It seems to him as if his eyes are only now open to what is near.\nThese things that he now sees, he sees them for the first time. These things were veiled during the cold phase of his convalescence and sickness. But they were also hidden from his sight while in the hearth. Seeing these things and feeling the sun\u0026rsquo;s warmth gives the free spirit a taste of genuine, natural \u0026ldquo;health\u0026rdquo; for the first time.\nIn religious and metaphysical terms, the things that the free spirit sees for the first time during his descent represent the natural world itself, which, devoid of supernatural explanations and stripped of grand narratives, are finally seen as they really are.\nWithout a belief in a mysterious impersonal force dictating the trajectory of your life, how would you see a flower for the very first time?\nNietzsche argues that without a metaphysical or supernatural foundation for the world, something that our inherited religious traditions provide, things (and our life, for that matter) are revealed for what they truly are—fragile and transient. And by virtue of their transience and fragility, they become more precious. We want to be nearer them. And this leads us to a newfound warmth, reminiscent of but entirely different from the warmth of the hearth where we came from—a freeing warmth from the sun.\nIn my story, I entered the warm phase of convalescence around 2014 when I left college and went back home to Pangasinan, which distanced me from my political organization and advocacies. With nothing else to do, I prioritized introspection.\nAround this time, I also discovered Eastern philosophy and spirituality through a writer named Dave Ursillo. Reading the [[tao te ching|Tao Te Ching]], the [[bhagavad gita|Bhagavad Gita]], the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and more contemporary books like Echart Tolle\u0026rsquo;s [[the power of now|The Power of Now]] made me realize that I still resonated with existential questions, religious subjects, and spiritual practices. For ten years, from 2014 to 2024, I shifted between this warm and cold convalescence and sometimes even returned to nihilism. But these days, I definitely have more moments of warm sunlight.\nGreat Health #The last phase is \u0026ldquo;the great health of the spirit,\u0026rdquo; which is simply warm convalescence prolonged. In this phase, the free spirit becomes comfortable with life outside the hearth—outside inherited religious and metaphysical traditions that require supernatural explanations and grand narratives.\nThe free spirit becomes attuned to being with a fragile universe yet learns a new kind of love. Per Bearn, this \u0026ldquo;different kind of love, producing a new happiness, is a love of what is precisely not immune to disaster, of what is delicate. This happiness, this great health, is a security within the shadow of risk, of fragility.\u0026rdquo;\nThe free spirit grows healthy once more precisely because he is no longer afraid of the delicateness and impermanence of life. This fragility motivates him not to run cowering back to the hearth, back toward a God that would save him. Instead, this fragility motivates him to hold every moment of his life with love and care, knowing each could be his last.\nIn my story, I have yet to enter great health, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m done with my convalescence. The memories and emotions that flooded me during [[uman 2023-10|my walk around Baguio last October 2023 ]] are proof that there is still some work to be done before I can confidently say I\u0026rsquo;m comfortable living and thriving away from the religious hearth I inherited from my parents. And here lies the answer to why I need to do the Baguio walks.\nFirst, walking back to these old places allows me to face emotions I haven\u0026rsquo;t been aware of for years. These emotions, in turn, tell me where I am in my journey. Without them, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to say how much I\u0026rsquo;ve healed or if I still need to do anything to get better.\nSecond, re-walking these routes facilitates the incorporation I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to do since 2022 when I started asking the question, \u0026ldquo;What are the things in my past life that I particularly enjoyed and which I could reintroduce in my new life?\u0026rdquo;\nThat question led me to the realization that I want to return to the words \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;spirituality\u0026rdquo; and use them to describe the life and work I\u0026rsquo;m doing instead of hiding behind words like \u0026ldquo;philosophy\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;contemplation.\u0026rdquo; It also made me realize I still want to engage in some form of \u0026ldquo;ministry,\u0026rdquo; which puts me in direct contact with other people, like the work I did in the past with the Deaf community, unlike the solitary writing life I\u0026rsquo;m immersed in these days. Thinking about my past life as a JW motivates me to rethink concepts such as faith and prayer and see how I could still use and embrace them even when I now identify as a non-theist.\nHeidegger said, \u0026ldquo;Overcoming is worthy only when we think about incorporation.\u0026rdquo; I overcame my childhood religion but haven\u0026rsquo;t incorporated that rich past into my new life; therefore, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t claim that my work in the convalescence phase is done.\nTo close this phase, I need to intentionally and carefully return to the past, converse with it, understand what really happened, and see how I can move forward with the insights I take from such a return. Walking is necessary in closing this stage in my journey to becoming free because it facilitates this incorporation process.\nUnlike mere recollection, walking is both experiential and intellectual. Experience here is crucial because it guards against potentially hurtful memories. While walking in Baguio, memories did return, but I also couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but notice what the place looked like right now. The present, which is still welcoming of the past by nature, is also detached from it. This detachment opens the way for reimagining places and creating new meanings for them.\nWhen I joined that progressive political organization in college that same year I left the JWs, I was running toward the nearest tower to save me from a life without Jehovah and his organization. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t admit it at that time, but I was terrified.\nWithout the grand narratives of the original sin, salvation through Jesus, the coming end of the world, and Christ\u0026rsquo;s thousand-year reign over a paradise earth, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to make sense of the world. The world has almost instantly become an unfamiliar wilderness. Somehow, I fooled myself into believing that a gravely deficient understanding of Marxist thought would save me from all these. Soon after leaving school, I realized how empty and alone my life was.\nFortunately, it didn\u0026rsquo;t take too long to see that what really made me feel warm was engaging with existence—seeing how ordinary objects and events are portals to existential questions and emotions. I feel warmth in spirituality and religion, which is the merging of the cosmic and the personal. And so, no matter how hard I tried to approach the world in a scholarly fashion, using pure theory and the things I learned in the university to interpret the world, this didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me. It\u0026rsquo;s a cold way of approaching reality.\nTheory is okay, but it has to help me feel warm. For it to inspire me, I have to extract the poetry out of it, or if it lacks this, I need to use it to create poetry, which I\u0026rsquo;m using here liberally not to refer to the literary form but to the way of living and expressing one\u0026rsquo;s thoughts and emotions, which resists subordination. In Bernadette Mayer\u0026rsquo;s words, \u0026ldquo;Poetry makes sure language has no masters.\u0026rdquo;\nMy convalescence from the sickness of nihilism, this return to where the sun warms, began around 2014, two years after I left the JWs. But it was characterized by an exploration of the spiritual and religious traditions of the \u0026ldquo;other.\u0026rdquo; I was still resisting returning to my past. In short, I was returning and attempting a return, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t complete. To complete this return, I need to really return, to walk back to where things started, a return which ironically began through a long walk at an entirely different place in 2022.\nI am still in recovery, trying my best to make things a bit warmer. I should be descending in lower altitudes, but funnily, I had to ascend a mountain where it was very cold to feel spiritually warm. But I welcome the irony of existence, which is becoming my norm.\nWhile re-walking my path on my first walk in Baguio as a JW away from his parents, I noticed something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t seen before.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember walking here and seeing this beautiful view of Mt. Data. Perhaps I saw it but never cared.\nWhile re-walking Rimando Road to return to the kingdom hall, I noticed something for the first time.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve walked Rimando Road several times as a JW, but I was too consumed by religious thoughts, I\u0026rsquo;ve never stopped to even notice how clear a view it offers of Aurora Hill.\nAs I walked back, I crossed a bridge that revealed the Balili River from below, a spectacle I saw for the first time.\nThroughout this walk, this was the time when I felt my camera calling. I picked it up and used its zoom not to take a good photo but to look at the river closely and with focus.\nWhile looking closely at the Balili River, I am reminded that I, too, am a river of sorts—ever-changing, ever-flowing. And this ever-flowing nature is what makes me who I am.\nNietzsche says these events are something to be expected. Once removed from the shackles of the hearth, the suicidal sickness of nihilism, and the coldness of a detached existence, the free spirit sits silently astonished and exclaims, \u0026ldquo;Where had [I] been? These near and nearest things: how changed they seem! What bloom and magic they have acquired!\u0026rdquo;\nBearn, G. (1997).

But after writing and sending yesterday\u0026rsquo;s essay, I felt strongly that it must be the essay that ends this first attempt to re-walk Baguio City.\nTruth be told, I could\u0026rsquo;ve lumped all three walks into a single walk since they all shared a similar route, namely Upper Bonifacio Street, Lower Bonifacio Street, and Rimando Road. If I were walking these routes in the context of the \u0026ldquo;Roots x Gravel\u0026rdquo; (week-long walk of Los Baños) that I did last December, I could\u0026rsquo;ve finished walking all of them in one day. But walking around Baguio is different. The meanings attached to almost every corner of that city are too much to be revisited in a single day.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve lived in Los Baños for three years already—the same number of years I lived in Baguio City as a JW minister. And yet, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say I have attached as much meaning to Los Baños as I had in Baguio. There was just too much activity happening in my young life from 2008 to 2011, too much passion for religion, that I\u0026rsquo;m realizing just now how much occurred throughout those years.\nTherefore, walking Baguio demands this slow, careful, and mindful stride that balances a desire to remember with an intention to protect oneself by being present in place and moment as much as possible.\nI noticed that walking did help me be present in the places I visited. Of course, I constantly reminded myself to be there—to return to place the same way I return to my breath during meditation and to see these places primarily as new ones, not reservoirs of past narratives. Surprisingly, memories did come, but in minimal amounts, during the walks. Most of the memories I included in my missives came when I was already writing about the places \u0026ldquo;after\u0026rdquo; the walks.\nSince walking in Baguio last October 2023 flooded me with memories, what was different in these walks? I think it was my intention to be present in place as much as possible, which prevented the memories from flooding me in the middle of the walks this time. Of course, mindful walking also helped put me back in the present moment.\nThe Walks #Since presence and remembering were the priorities of this walk, I decided not to share the number of steps and kilometers covered by these three walks in my daily missives. But for those who want to put more perspective on the effort needed to perform these walks, here are the numbers:\nDay 1: 15,851 steps; 5.75 km Day 2: 10,858 steps; 6.61 km Day 4: 13,577 steps; 6.27 km These walks happened on around 23 streets in Baguio, covering around 14 barangays. The map of the entire walk is shown below. This map is a visual representation of the routes most covered by my feet in my three years of serving here as a JW minister for people who are deaf and hard of hearing.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next #I\u0026rsquo;m currently in Pangasinan to spend about a week with my parents. Pangasinan is just two hours away from Baguio, so I often stay here before or after visiting the mountain city.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll return to Los Baños after a week, where I might switch to other non-walk-related matters, including freelance work (!) because I need to eat and save money to fund future walks. That said, returning to the walking Los Baños project is definitely part of the months ahead. I want to return to my writings, see what else I can do, and hopefully begin a book project. After doing the Baguio walk, I think I now know better how to frame the book about walking Los Baños. To move this project forward, I\u0026rsquo;ll do at least another week-long walk of Los Baños, which would include sending a photography-only email newsletter to any of you interested.\nAs for Baguio, I would like to continue walking the city, of course. But after this trial walk, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about doing a few necessary tweaks:\nWalk Baguio in less cold months (around March to May). I underestimated the cold, making my stay in the city a bit uncomfortable. Heating wasn\u0026rsquo;t available in my sister\u0026rsquo;s house, so working and sleeping in the evening was challenging. I was used to the cold when I lived here 12 years ago. Now, my body has forgotten it (among other things I\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten about this city), so I need to be mindful of getting warm next time. Stay in a place where I can have more solitude. I stayed with my sister and her family to save money (these trips aren\u0026rsquo;t cheap, which is also a critique of the walking methodology!). Although I enjoyed being with my nephew and nieces longer (and that, I think, helped me process and take a rest from the thoughts and emotions I was writing about), it wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy to write in the afternoon and early hours of the evening when the children returned from school. I tried to make the most of it but wrote most missives past 9 pm when the children were asleep. Next time, I should arrange to stay with a friend (with no kids!) or rent a place for a few days to concentrate better when writing the missives after the walks. Begin exploring non-JW walks. Returning to my past through walking Baguio is the central theme of these walks, and I\u0026rsquo;m not yet done exploring this theme. For example, one possible sub-theme of future Baguio walks could involve returning to the \u0026ldquo;deaf routes\u0026rdquo; I used to walk to visit bible students who were deaf or hard of hearing. (Who knows, I might even reunite with some of these students?) That said, I noticed while doing the third walk that there are still many places in Baguio with no JW-related memories attached to them. These places, I think, are critical to the adjacent project of \u0026ldquo;reimagining\u0026rdquo; Baguio after leaving the JWs. Thank You #Before I shut the doors for this walk, I would like to use this moment to express my gratitude to you properly. The subject of this walk is too niche (who cares about JWs?) that I\u0026rsquo;m surprised a handful of you even read my emails. I would still do these walks and write these missives even if no one reads them because I am doing them for myself first. I need to do them for my sanity. To have someone read them is already a bonus. But a bonus that helps me process the past and face the future better.\nSince I started writing about my personal history with the JWs, friends and readers began reaching out to me, telling me their stories of \u0026ldquo;conversions\u0026rdquo; within a particular religious tradition or from one religious tradition to another. Almost everyone who trusted me with their stories told me of the \u0026ldquo;pain\u0026rdquo; inherent in such detachment processes and the \u0026ldquo;necessity\u0026rdquo; that such separation demanded.\nI, myself, am still in the process of truly understanding how these processes of detachment happen (thus, these walks). Because of this, I don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers. In fact, I have very few of them! But all I know is that committing a portion of my time and skills to address this specific human experience opens up a portal for at least a few of us to understand better, on a personal level, the larger cracks and wounds we see in the fabric of society that arose because of the tension between the human desire to be authentic and the human difficulty to tolerate that which is different.\nI\u0026rsquo;m doing my best. I know and trust that we all do. So, thank you for being here, walking with me, and trusting the path.\nIf you need anything, please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to reach out.\nUntil the next walk,\nVince\n","date":"19 January 2024","permalink":"/tt1/005/","section":"Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1","summary":"","title":"Tall Tales — The End (For Now)"},{"content":"A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk of Baguio City from January 15–21, 2024.

Now that I think about it, I believe we\u0026rsquo;ve never walked all of it. Perhaps a few steps here and there. But never the entire length of it.\nThis morning, I walked the walk we never had.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking for their houses. If I never left (if I never left you), I would\u0026rsquo;ve immediately found them. All I can remember is that both houses are along this road.\nRuins of a house that once stood here show on the corners of this vacant lot. I have a hunch that this is one of the houses. I\u0026rsquo;m baffled at how surprised I am. It is as if I left just yesterday. I had to remind myself that all these images were from twelve years ago.\nAn old man sitting outside a door held the hand of what seems to be his grandson as the child was about to enter the house. He pulls the boy toward him and kisses his cheek. He does this repeatedly as he shouts the name of the boy. Neighbors stopped whatever they were doing to watch this public display of affection. The child has down syndrome. With every kiss the grandfather gives, the neighbors see how much the child is loved.\nThis is the route I took the morning after we told each other this couldn\u0026rsquo;t go on. It was a Monday morning. The night before, we both slept over at the couple\u0026rsquo;s house after a long day in the ministry. We were invited along with one or two other friends. We had dinner, laughed together, pretended nothing was happening underneath it all. But when we exchanged gazes, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but notice your eyes were trying to tell me something I\u0026rsquo;m still trying to decipher today.\nAt midnight when everyone was asleep, I sent you a text message telling you to meet me at the living room. I moved slowly out of bed and closed the door carefully as to not wake up our friend. Perhaps, you did the same.\nYou told me your father already knew about us. You told me he advised you to cut things off. He told you to say to me it was unwise to promise love to a sister when I intend to enter missionary training, which requires trainees to be single. I was just 18 and wasn\u0026rsquo;t anywhere near the requirements to enter missionary training. To be qualified, I need around five more years, give or take. That would be a reasonable waiting time. Some brothers waited ten years before being accepted.\nI told you I\u0026rsquo;ve also talked to my father about us, and he said the same, albeit a bit more unkindly. We both agreed it must end. That midnight, we went back to our separate rooms without saying goodbye. We knew that in the following days, we would continue to see each other at the kingdom hall and work together in the field ministry. These we would do while we begin the long, painful process of killing this thing that naturally blossomed between us. The anxiety of how the next days would unfold kept me up most of that night.\nIn the kingdom hall, we were taught how to read the bible, interpret it, use its verses masterfully to devise bulletproof arguments defending our faith. What they never taught us was how to hold our hearts with utmost care like our lives depended on it.\nIt was a walk I have almost no memory of. A thought-less walk. An image-less walk. A walk I\u0026rsquo;m doing as if for the first time. These are houses I don\u0026rsquo;t remember. These are unfamiliar walls. These are turns I may or may not have ever made.\nIs this the pavement I walked on as I tried to find my way back home, unaware that it would be my last walk in the realm of sanity?\nAs I pass by Bayan Park,\nthe leaves of a lone bamboo\ngreet me with the wind.\nDid I ever tell you that the following morning after that walk I\u0026rsquo;m trying to replicate today (perhaps unsuccessfully), I took another walk, an early one inside this park?\nBefore that morning, I\u0026rsquo;ve never went up this hill. Before that morning, this park was just a lump of soil I glanced upon before riding the jeep that would take me to town.\nThat morning, I remember waking up feeling so sad. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried about it. I told myself it was only natural to feel sad about how things ended between us.\nThat sadness remained unchanged until Friday, when we met again at the meeting. After arriving home, I texted you, I\u0026rsquo;m still feeling down and you told me you were feeling the same. I still wasn\u0026rsquo;t worried.\nWhen that sadness extended for another week, coupled with an inability to sleep and a tiredness that made my eyeballs sweat, I began to worry—that was when I knew something was wrong with me.\nDid I ever bring you here? Did you ever see this hole where I slept after spending all those hours with you in the field?\nI like to think I did. Although when and how and what happened, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t remember.\nKept inside this hole I deepened my adoration of our God. Kept inside this hole I deepened my adoration of you.\nIt was in here where I created the maps of the places we walked together in the city and beyond. It was behind this door where I typed every single one of those records—names, addresses, educational attainment, notes from ministers who\u0026rsquo;ve visited (including yours)—of every person who is deaf or hard of hearing in the city and neighboring towns. These are records of our work together. These are archives of our love.\nIn the evenings, this is the stairs I used to sit on as I talked with you for hours (I had to get out of the house so my sister won\u0026rsquo;t hear our murmurs). It must\u0026rsquo;ve been so cold during those nights—as cold as it is today. It was during those calls when I first saw the lights on the hills of Ambiong. I would later learn that those lights came from flower farms. To grow better (and faster?), some flowers needed a longer day, which is accomplished by night-interrupting lights.\nIn that short period from 2010 to 2011, I desired the opposite. I needed longer nights, so I could have more of your voice.\nThese words and images come to me after the walk.\nWhile in the walk, I was \u0026ldquo;in\u0026rdquo; the walk. Almost no words and images arrive as I revisit the route I took that day. My feet brings me back to where I am now and pulls me to the only place that is true.\nBut my mind doesn\u0026rsquo;t forget. I still remember you—your face, your voice—as I sit and look at these photographs.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare ask the question (what could\u0026rsquo;ve been?). I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dare.\nBut twelve years is like a lifetime. And we are now living our second lives. The only way forward is to be here.\nSince the mind remembers but the feet forgets, I shall walk and walk and walk, until everything that took place before is but a flickering light over the silhouette of a hill, until everything is but a murmur floating on a staircase at night.\n","date":"18 January 2024","permalink":"/tt1/004/","section":"Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1","summary":"","title":"Tall Tales Day 4 — Nights"},{"content":"Walking on the inclining driveway, I saw that the cafe\u0026rsquo;s windows above the parking lot were open. There seemed to be no customers, and I even thought they were close had I not heard an almost silent jazz tune playing on a small speaker as I climbed the stairs that led me to the door.\nLa Casa Bianca. For a crowded city like Baguio, it is one of a kind. I discovered it through two friends, a couple who sold their house in South Luzon and relocated to Baguio only to move back south to Manila after frequent power interruptions prevented them from conducting their startup. They said they liked it because it is usually empty, even on the weekends, and the music isn\u0026rsquo;t distracting. One can write or read here, and the food isn\u0026rsquo;t bad.\nI decided to take the day off. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t tired. The two walks I did in the past two days were shorter than those I did in Los Baños last December. However, I needed space to process some of the thoughts and emotions from those two walks, mainly because these are new ones.\nThe crew stood up from their seats when they saw me enter the door. Good afternoon, they greeted. Good afternoon, I greeted back. I walked straight to my favorite spot: a table at the left corner of the cafe beside a window. I sat down to read the menu then went to the cashier to order. As I returned to my table, I closed half of the window: it was getting colder and colder as the days pass by here in Baguio, a reason why I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to cut the days of the walk.\nInstead of ending it on the 21st, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to do a final walk on the 19th before traveling to Pangasinan to stay with my parents for about a week. Aside from the cold, Baguio is currently experiencing an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis due to contaminated water in some areas of the city. I\u0026rsquo;ve been safe so far, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to put myself at more risk. So, I\u0026rsquo;ll do one more walk tomorrow and see if I could do another on Friday. But two walks would be my max. There are so many routes I could still walk on, so many more places to be with, so many more memories that could be unearth, but I\u0026rsquo;ll reserve all of them on a second Baguio walk, probably around summer, on May, when it is less colder.\nSitting here at La Casa Bianca, alone, I think about the reasons why we seek for places such as this. Last week, I finished reading Craig Mod\u0026rsquo;s pop-up newsletter on his tour of Jazz kissas around Japan. The word kissa comes from the Japanese word kissaten or \u0026ldquo;tea-drinking shop.\u0026rdquo; It is Japan\u0026rsquo;s version of the cafe, a space where people gather to drink and commune. Jazz kissas, which became popular when Japan embraced the West after World War II, are spaces dedicated solely for listening to jazz. Dark lit and with loud music, jazz kissas discourage reading and talking. Patrons visit them for a particular experience often not found in their day-to-day lives.\nIn populous Baguio, a place like La Casa Bianca provides me with a specific experience I can\u0026rsquo;t find at my sister\u0026rsquo;s place or in any other of the popular cafes down Session Road: the solitude I need to review the thoughts and emotions I experienced in two walks I just completed.\nAs a writer and artist with a particular interest to philosophy, religion, and spirituality, I\u0026rsquo;d like to think of my work also as something that creates a particular experience, an experience my readers seldom find out there. Therefore, the question I should be asking is not \u0026ldquo;where can I find this experience?\u0026rdquo; but \u0026ldquo;how can I co-create this experience for myself and others who might need it?\u0026rdquo; In other words, instead of looking for a kissa or cafe that would give me what I\u0026rsquo;m looking for, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be better for me to co-create that space and, therefore, expand the access to the experience I and others are looking for? According to Craig Mod, this is exactly how jazz kissas grew in popularity in Japan. Patrons of existing jazz kissas fell in love with them that they were inspired to open their own kissas in consultation with the owners of the original kissas.\nI would like to see myself as a kissa of sorts. But what I\u0026rsquo;m building is not an unmoving physical structure but a living, breathing, portable, walking kissa. What I hope is that my words, writings, photographs, actions, and, more importantly, my very presence bring the experience I want others to have, one that isn\u0026rsquo;t always readily available in the world out there.\nAfter finishing two walks, is there anything I could already take home from this project?\nOne day, I would like to return to these spaces, not hiding or avoiding encounters, but bringing my truest self. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean seeking encounters but being open to them when they occur and trusting that something good will come out of seeing people I used to know and love.\nThis is something I need to think about because I can\u0026rsquo;t run away from these potential encounters. My parents are both deep in the faith. They\u0026rsquo;ve grown deeper ever since I left. They\u0026rsquo;re also getting older each year and I can\u0026rsquo;t help but contemplate how I would continue to exist when either or both of them are gone.\nThey would both want a JW sendoff where JW families and friends would gather to remember them. I would be there, of course. In fact, that would only be the occasion when, I think, I\u0026rsquo;ll truly be there around people I\u0026rsquo;ve left in the church. I want to be there as my truest self, not someone who has grown cold in faith and in need of assistance to return (as my parents and those who know me in the church clearly see me). I want my words, actions, and presence to show that I\u0026rsquo;m someone completely new. I want them to radiate the experience I want people to have when my kissa is around them—an experience I am yet to articulate, but something that is definitely filled with compassion and openness to differences. That won\u0026rsquo;t happen unless I make peace with the past, unless I rediscover the emotions I tried to forget but can\u0026rsquo;t, unless I process and alchemize them into something more inspiring and useful.\nAlthough it was a rational decision, triggered by depression, my choice to leave my religion was propelled with a lot of anger. I was angry to my parents for not granting my request to leave my studies a semester before the depression happened. I was angry to the elders who didn\u0026rsquo;t defend their initial decision and to the overseer who overturned it. For a while, I was angry at religion and agreed that all its forms must be eliminated.\nThat anger has now subsided, and I owe this from my meditation practice, which began with zen and has now transitioned to seiza. And in the past two days, walking, being present in these long-forgotten places, and writing about the people once dear to my heart for the first time, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but to notice the complete absence of anger. Instead, what I honestly feel now is a genuine curiosity to what might have happened to all these people I left.\nRemember one of the child I wrote about in day one, the one whose older brother also left the church years before I did, I saw her that very day after I wrote about her on my phone. I was crossing the overpass at Maharlika on my way home when I saw her stop just before the stairs I was climbing. I wanted to hug her, tell her it was me, ask her how she is, where she\u0026rsquo;ve been, how her parents are. But I can\u0026rsquo;t. I just can\u0026rsquo;t. And I felt it in my bones that whatever this thing that held me back from being human at that moment was just wrong, was something that has to be overcome.\nOur beliefs shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be what prevents us from communion. Instead, they should make us thirsty for connection (and reconnection).\nMy dream is to come to these unavoidable encounters a different but kind person, someone who isn\u0026rsquo;t angry about anything or anyone, but someone who is genuinely interested and curious, perhaps even to catch up with all those lost years, to co-create a space for human to human communion, without judgement and prejudice, to listen deeply despite the barrier of religious difference.\nThis is the direction I want to take—to explore the possibility of sitting down with my neighbor no matter how different they are. And it is my hope that, somehow, these walks will take me toward that direction.\n","date":"17 January 2024","permalink":"/tt1/003/","section":"Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1","summary":"","title":"Tall Tales Day 03 — A Walking Kissa"},{"content":"On my way to Bugallon Street, I walked past the kingdom hall at Rimando once more. Unlike yesterday, no people were working around it today. The building is all by itself. I stopped beside the road directly opposite it and stared at this side of the building.\nI immediately saw the schedule of services posted just outside its gate. The Tagalog congregation seems to have changed its name from Summerhill to North. The sign language congregation has retained its old schedule: Friday evenings and Sunday afternoons.\nThe Sunday afternoon schedule was strategic. Signers (what we used to call most \u0026ldquo;hearing\u0026rdquo; sign language interpreters) would use Sunday mornings to fetch their bible students, who usually lived in far places of Baguio (like Outlook Drive) or even La Trinidad, so that they could attend the afternoon meetings.\nSundays are usually busy for us in the sign language ministry. We fetched bible students in the morning, attended the meetings in the afternoon, and then conducted individual bible studies with the same students we fetched in the morning right after the meetings. By doing everything in one day, we save time and money. For a college student with limited financial resources, this strategy was crucial for me. Almost always, I pay for my bible student\u0026rsquo;s fare and lunch. The organization had no funds for such expenses. We volunteered our time as well as our money. This is how I learned selflessness.\nI walked past the house of an elder I was close with. I made a mental note that this was where I learned how to drink at 17.\nUnlike most other Christian denominations, JWs are not too strict about drinking (at least during the years I was there). Alcoholic beverages were expected to be available during the more casual gatherings, and even elders used them to build camaraderie among the men in the congregation. The organization perhaps has been a bit lax in how it dealt with alcohol that alcoholism became a common problem among several congregations in Baguio, a place with a deep indigenous cultural attachment with intoxicants. This is, of course, knowledge handed to me during many gossiping sessions with my mentors in the church.\nA small bulldozer is parked where we used to wait for a taxi. In front of the bulldozer are pieces of broken cement, perhaps the same cement the soles of our leather shoes touched during all those hours of waiting for rides.\nAt first, the sister, her husband, and I rode the taxi. Sometimes, Kuya Mon would ride with us. I stayed with the sister and her husband for two months in 2010 before the second semester of my second year ended. The following semester, my sister (the youngest) would join me in Baguio for her first year in college. She landed a spot in the Language and Literature program at UPB. To prepare for her arrival, I looked for an apartment we would share.\nWhile looking for an apartment, the sister and her husband generously took me in. I didn\u0026rsquo;t pay for rent or utilities. They even fed me breakfast and dinner. For the first time, I was treated like a real brother by people I don\u0026rsquo;t share my blood with.\nThe sister and her husband had a huge age gap, and this fact made its way to many of our jokes. They also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a child (didn\u0026rsquo;t want one or couldn\u0026rsquo;t have one?), so welcoming me into their space was easier. The sister\u0026rsquo;s mother often visited and, at one point, decided to stay with the couple for a year or so. She arrived when I was there and soon joined our little band of taxi waiters.\nShe, too, made me feel like I was her son. We talked and talked for hours on end. She told me about her suitors and life in the fishing village in Quezon, where she grew up. I told her that although our municipality was quite far from the sea, it was near my heart.\nAround the time when I moved out of the sister and her husband\u0026rsquo;s apartment to join my sister in our place in Aurora Hill, a cousin of the sister moved from Manila to Baguio with her three sons. One of her sons was going to college, and they thought a new start in Baguio could be helpful to all of them. I grew an affinity with these boys and often slept over on Saturday nights to help the family prepare for the Tagalog meetings the following morning.\nThe sister\u0026rsquo;s cousin had an unbeliever husband who worked abroad. Left with no male to lead her boys at home, she told me once I was a father figure to them. Hearing this from her surprised me. I had just turned 18, yet through my words and actions, I was already shaping the character of three young men, the eldest being only two years younger than me. During that year before my depression, I did my best to live up to their mother\u0026rsquo;s expectations. Having been mentored by grown men in the congregation, I thought sharing that gift with these boys who badly needed it was just right.\nWhen they learned I had to leave school and go home to recover from my depression, the eldest son called me. He was crying on the phone. He asked whether I had caught something severe. He talked to me like I had cancer. I told him I\u0026rsquo;m not dying. But that call made me feel how much I meant to him.\nWriting this now puts more perspective on the suffering I went through. While in the middle of depression, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to see beyond the pain. The mind reorganizes itself and dramatically changes. It forgets about others, shuts them down completely, so people who once relied on a person with depression are neglected.\nEven when I was relieved of my worst symptoms (insomnia, panic attacks, chronic fatigue, and suicidal ideations) and saw a glimmer of hope, I still had to focus on getting back on my feet. The work required by all of these is too much it could take years before one could acclimate with one\u0026rsquo;s new brain. The decision to leave the religion made things worse: I abandoned my bible students, I abandoned my friends, I abandoned the younger human who looked up to me, I abandoned Kuya Mon.\nI woke up one day after several years, realizing that I\u0026rsquo;ve lost almost everyone I knew, almost everyone I\u0026rsquo;ve ever cared for.\nKuya Mon wasn\u0026rsquo;t born blind. He got blind in middle age. He grew up with the sister\u0026rsquo;s husband in non-JW households. Kuya Mon didn\u0026rsquo;t tell me his story directly. Perhaps it was too difficult for him to return to those memories. But the sister\u0026rsquo;s husband told me when Kuya Mon lost his eyesight, his family (yes, his immediate family), seeing that he would no longer be of use and would be too much trouble, packed his things one day and kicked him out of the house. His own blood forsook Kuya Mon because of his disability.\nThe sister\u0026rsquo;s husband said Kuya Mon wanted to kill himself and was very much intent on doing so. Moved by what happened to his close friend and unable to ignore Kuya Mon\u0026rsquo;s situation, the sister\u0026rsquo;s husband, with his mother\u0026rsquo;s permission, took Kuya Mon in. The mother treated him like her own son.\nThe sister\u0026rsquo;s husband later met the JWs and got baptized. Kuya Mon followed suit. Becoming a JW gave Kuya Mon a purpose, one that was enough for him to forget about suicide. When I met Kuya Mon, he was already a regular pioneer in the Tagalog congregation. Unable to read, he listened to all available audio recordings of JW publications, including the bible. Kuya Mon had a sharp memory. He could recite several bible verses by heart.\nSometimes, religion and spirituality give purpose to people like Kuya Mon, who have lost almost everything. In cases like Kuya Mon\u0026rsquo;s, I honestly (although still uneasy) feel genuine gratefulness for beliefs, even those I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily agree with. When one witnesses how certain ideas tailored into spoken and written words could affect how individuals behave toward each other, creating a new family for those who lost theirs, one could at least be happy for those whose lives have been uplifted by such ideas.\nOf course, not all ideas are for everyone. Now that I think about it, I could\u0026rsquo;ve just disregarded the doctrines taught in the kingdom hall, which I no longer resonated with—doctrines like the existence of a God, the divine inspiration of the bible, and the divine authority of the governing body. When I was removed as a ministerial servant, I could\u0026rsquo;ve just reminded myself of the good things the religion has done for people like Kuya Mon and stayed. But I\u0026rsquo;m not Kuya Mon. I was given an entirely different set of cards.\nA gift I owe from my depression experience was the realization that for an idea to take hold of me (as it did with Kuya Mon), it isn\u0026rsquo;t enough that it is beautiful and inspiring. Sometimes, I don\u0026rsquo;t care whether an idea is beautiful at all. What holds me and inspires me are ideas that are honest and true. Even if they don\u0026rsquo;t inspire many people, even if they\u0026rsquo;re unpopular, they resonate strongly with me.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough that an idea was beautiful or that it could change lives. First, I need it to be honest and truthful before I can really embrace it as my own.\nYes, I could\u0026rsquo;ve stayed and continued to enjoy the family I had within the organization. But depression has already broken the parchment curtain. I can\u0026rsquo;t unsee what I have seen. For me, to stay is to live in a beautiful thing built under a foundation of lies.\nBack at Rimando Road, I walked slowly, trying to remember what it felt like to have Kuya Mon\u0026rsquo;s palm on my right shoulder and the pace of our walk. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember slowing down. Kuya Mon always kept up. We just had to be mindful of our steps, especially on staircases. But he walked fast and well like anyone else.\nSuddenly, I felt the burden of imagining someone holding my right shoulder. Suddenly, it felt right to return to the walk as it is happening today. Suddenly, letting go of Kuya Mon walking behind me felt alright.\nWhere is he now? Did he ever learn to walk by himself? Is he still even alive? Gosh, it\u0026rsquo;s been 12 years, I told myself. Who among them is still alive?\nThis is where we used to gather before field ministry. Almost all JWs, no matter what congregation, used this spot. It is where we waited for brothers and sisters. Due to the terrible Baguio traffic, they almost always arrived late. While waiting, some of us would sit in this space holding a magazine up for people to see, an archaic method. Those more contemporary in their approach walked around giving tracts to people.\nA photographer once held an exhibit at SM Baguio. His works featured different religious individuals in various scenarios around the city. One of his photos featured a sister sitting on this bench holding a magazine up and chatting with another sister while someone was doing her toenails. The photographer named his piece \u0026ldquo;Sunday Manicure.\u0026rdquo;\nToday, I sit across it: an empty bench. People pass by, but no one sits on it. Fifteen years ago, this bench was rarely vacated. A sister or brother, usually an older one, was always sitting on this bench holding a magazine up. Today, alone, it breathes and breathes well. Like me, it tries to catch up to all those lost years.\nNearby, a young man walks slowly as an older guy holds him on his right shoulder. The older guy wasn\u0026rsquo;t blind; probably had a stroke. It\u0026rsquo;s an entirely different thing, but it was close to how me and Kuya Mon looked like years ago when we walked Rose Garden and Burnham Park looking for a meek-looking person to talk to about the hope we both shared about a new world devoid of all illness and disability and filled only with joy and compassion.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a message I\u0026rsquo;ve let go twelve years ago when I left the JWs. But everyone who walks with their truth in their hearts will always have a soft place in my heart.\n","date":"16 January 2024","permalink":"/tt1/002/","section":"Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1","summary":"","title":"Tall Tales Day 02 — Families"},{"content":"I begin here where it all started: a boarding house downstairs from an elevated road. When I walked down this road in the past, coming home from school, I used to see the roof of the house below me, red as it still is today.\nAside from this red roof and the stairs, I have very little memory of what the house looked like from the outside. All I know is that it is no longer as I remember it. The walls of this new house are painted orange and white. It is now tightly fenced (with chicken wires above the fence). And a guard house was built beside what was once just a humble gate.\nA taxi stops in front of the heavily secured house. I walked past the gate and found a space across the road where I could stand from afar while still seeing the house. I joined a man waiting for a ride. Many vehicles drive by this road at this hour. Definitely more than what used to pass by here 15 years ago. There are a few jeepneys but most are taxis.\nThe taxi leaves.\nA few moments later, someone comes out of the gate. A teenager with her ID\u0026rsquo;s garland hanging around her neck. She locks the gate as she leaves.\nI remember that there were two rooms on the first floor: one beside the living room and one beside the kitchen. I slept in the room near the kitchen along with two other boys from the same high school I went to back home. Upstairs were two rooms. One of those rooms had a large window, the largest in this house.\nIt is in this house where my first actual tests of obedience to the religion of my parents came. On the first week of college, my housemates, including my room mates (both minors like me) pressured me to join them in visiting the nearby drinking spots. I succeeded in rejecting their invitation but felt weird as I was left alone in the house that night.\nOnce, after arriving from a meeting at the Kingdom Hall, my sophomore housemates asked me to stay for a while so I could answer some of their questions about the end of the world. So who will be saved? they asked me. No one really knows, I said. But one can have more chance of being saved if one at least listens to Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s message in the Bible.\nI talked about the series of events leading to the complete annihilation of evil. When evil is wiped out, those saved will remain on earth to become co-creators of a paradise world. I left that conversation convincing most of them except one who was constantly skeptical.\nThe first walk I took as a JW living the religion of my parents away from them was most likely on a Wednesday on my way to attend a mid-week meeting. I wore maroon long sleeves partnered with a yellow tie with silver spots. I carried a leather sling bag with my bible, a songbook, and other pamphlets. Of course, I wore my leather shoes—the one with a long nose.\nI said goodbye to my roommates, passed by my housemates in the living room, climbed the stairs to the road, and began the walk to the nearest Kingdom Hall at Valenzuela Street. The meetings start before sunset and end at dark. I particularly love the walk back, the streets illuminated only by flickering street lights.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t remember walking here and seeing this beautiful view of Mt. Data. Perhaps I saw it but never cared. This point on the road gives one an excellent view of the mountain, famous for its Mickey-Mouse-like satellite disks and, of course, La Fresa, that fictional place popularized by a Tagalog television series.\nMt. Data is one of the most beautiful hikes I\u0026rsquo;ve ever done. In my first year, I took a PE class called \u0026ldquo;Walking for Fitness.\u0026rdquo; I took the course not because I already loved walking as I do now but because it sounded easy. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nOne of the walks we did was a hike to Mt. Data. We camped on a small hill under which, they said, was an ancestral graveyard. The morning after we spent the night over the mountain, I took a short walk from the camp to a nearby cliff where birds flew below. When I saw that beautiful cliff, I sat on a rock and remember telling myself, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll return to you in paradise.\u0026rdquo;\nAbout two years later, I would return to Mt. Data with a group of JW sign language interpreters to survey people who are deaf or hard of hearing. We spent an entire day asking around but found none.\nToday, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if a paradise earth is ever possible. I do know that I still hope to return to that beautiful cliff one day to see it as it was before.\nI walked outside the Baguio Convention Center, a place that meant very little to me the first time I passed it during my first year in Baguio. Later, it became an essential place of gravity in my growth as a JW.\nIn recent years, the Convention Center has gone through several transformations. For a while, it became an alternative bus terminal. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was used as a triage center for everyone entering the city.\nToday, skater boys play around its mostly vacant parking lot. I watched them for a few minutes before a guard asked them to leave.\nI took a photo of the Convention Center from afar, making the guard turn his eyes to me. He walked toward me but never approached. Perhaps he was making his presence known.\nOne of the many residues of Imelda Marcos\u0026rsquo; cultural investment in the 70s and 80s, the Convention Center was used sparingly during significant events and rented to private and religious groups for similar purposes. Security wasn\u0026rsquo;t this tight fifteen years ago and years before that. These guards, these fences that now surround it, and that gate in front only rose after I left Baguio in 2014.\nBefore I left, JWs had two assemblies and one convention per year. As the name suggests, circuit assemblies gather several adjacent congregations and groups from a circuit. Circuit assemblies are usually held for two days. The same circuit meets again in a special assembly held only for a day. When several circuits come together, it becomes a district convention, which happens once a year.\nJW sign language groups and congregations often rented the Convention Center for assemblies and conventions at least three times a year. The sign language congregations of Baguio and Benguet hosted these events, with congregations from lowland La Union, Ilocos, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Isabela, Tarlac, and Pampanga coming to the City of Pines for several days of spiritual nourishment.\nThose events were filled with camaraderie, and for a young minister and pastor with a dream to eventually be a missionary for this religion, learning about the different situations of the deaf community of Northern Luzon was also greatly instructional. My elders at the Baguio congregation trusted my sign language skills so much that in one district convention, they let me interpret the main talk of the district overseer who wasn\u0026rsquo;t versed in sign language.\nAfter I left the Baguio congregation in 2011 to recover from my depression, I transferred to a sign language group in Pangasinan. In an assembly or convention that year (which was also my last), I returned no longer as the host but as the guest. I remember feeling sad as I watched my former congregation members gather for lunch inside one of the few rooms inside the Convention Center. I stayed with my new group below, thinking of all the things I lost due to my illness.\nMy first boarding house at Military Cut-off has changed. The road that leads to it has changed. The Baguio Convention Center has changed. What has endured is this nearby piece of land filled with century-old pine trees. Guarded by heavy iron fences, I remember them looking like this fifteen years ago when I arrived in my first year in college. But I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed them before when I accompanied my father once when he renewed his license at the licensure office just across this park.\nNow, I stand behind the fence admiring these unmoved timbers, hoping to borrow some of their enduring fortitude for the walk ahead. Leaving Military Cut-off, the Baguio Convention Center, and the pine trees, I followed my feet toward the rest of TM Kalaw Street, leading to Upper Session Road, trying my best to remember the exact route I would\u0026rsquo;ve used in the past to get to the nearest Kingdom Hall.\nAlthough unsure of the exact route, I\u0026rsquo;m sure I used to go down the Igorot Stairs near the once-abandoned Casa Vallejo. This route is not the easiest. However, I was afraid of getting lost in wide Baguio, so I stuck with it during those first few weeks (or months?). I walked down these stairs and up after the meetings, making me completely exhausted when I got home.\nI would later learn of two more accessible routes: the first using Leonard Wood Road and North Drive and the second using Leonard Wood Road and Upper Session Road. Both are longer routes but avoid the stairs.\nThe kingdom hall was closed. Not closed as in it would open tomorrow but closed as in for good. The doors of its gate were padlocked and tied together by a rusty chain. A phallus graffiti adorns the left door, suggesting it has been closed for a while.\nBefore I left in 2012, this Kingdom Hall was home to four congregations: an Ilocano, a Tagalog, an English, and a Korean congregation (Baguio was that ripe in JW ministry). I no longer know the story behind this closure, but all of those congregations could only be accommodated by the new, bigger Kingdom Hall at Rimando Road, which I\u0026rsquo;ll see later in this walk.\nThis kingdom hall at Valenzuela Street was the first I ever worshipped in Baguio. Even before 2008 (my first year in college), I\u0026rsquo;ve already accompanied Brent, an American from Missouri who married a Filipina family friend from our congregation in Pangasinan, in Baguio, at least twice to attend the English congregation where he was previously associated. Brent had two of his toes cut due to diabetes, making him prone to tripping. During weeks with Brent, I assisted him when he walked to the kingdom hall and visited English-speaking foreigners around Baguio. Brent would later go back to the States with his wife. He would first die a few years before his wife. I\u0026rsquo;ve never reached out to them after I left the religion in 2012.\nIn my first week in Baguio as a first-year college student, I returned to this kingdom hall to attend several meetings of the English congregation. I can\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly why I didn\u0026rsquo;t continue attending those meetings at that congregation. My best guess was that the congregation lacked enough youngsters like me. Without people I knew I could befriend, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t feel the warmth I sought in a congregation. This moved me to attend other congregations. I moved to the Summerhill congregation, a larger Tagalog-speaking congregation whose membership is half composed of high school and college students. That congregation also had a sign language group at which I volunteered.\nI slowly moved my eyes across those iron letters welded above the gate\u0026rsquo;s doors. JWs have used this place for years. They may have thought they would use it forever. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of the malleability and impermanence of things. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of my own malleability and impermanence.\nBlack and white garbage bags lay along Valenzuela Street. It\u0026rsquo;s trash day, and the truck will arrive soon. A garbage man passes by. With only Php 20 or 30, residents hire someone like him to haul their garbage to the roadside.\nI, too, have things in need of hauling. But today, I am my own garbage man.\nMy niece and nephew go to this elementary school. This morning, before the walk, I escorted my nephew to his first class here. I returned after visiting the old kingdom hall, sitting on the renovated waiting shed and looking down. Below, I see two vehicles parked on the side of the road.\nI used to know a little boy and his sister who also attended this school. In 2011, when I left Baguio, the sister had graduated elementary school and, therefore, moved to the public high school. But since her brother still went to this school, she went here after her classes to join her parents, who parked their fx at either of the spots where these vehicles are now parked.\nI, too, used to go here to meet the family\u0026rsquo;s father in the afternoons. Their father is the closest thing to a spiritual father I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had. He was an elder at an Ilocano-speaking congregation (the Ilocano-speaking congregation that used the shutdown kingdom hall I just visited). After learning that the sign language group needed another elder to become a congregation, he talked to his wife about the matter, and both decided to move. Their move was the key for the group to become a full-fledged congregation, an achievement that happened in 2010, about a year before my depressive episode.\nI went here on this spot on afternoons to teach the family sign language since they never went through formal training. But I also went here to be mentored by the father (and, in some measure, even by the mother). The couple were regular pioneers. Regular pioneers or RPs are what JWs call members who have pledged 70 hours of preaching per month. Since this is a significant amount of time, only those who have genuinely simplified their lives by only taking part-time jobs could succeed in becoming RPs. The couple taught me everything they knew about living a life centered on serving Jehovah.\nThe boy and his sister have a brother who was a few years older than me. This brother was baptized in the faith but left later as a form of rebellion. I knew this brother. He lived with me in my second boarding house, in a spare area in the attic. He worked as a call center agent, so he was usually about to leave for work when I arrived and asleep during the weekends. We seldom talked.\nTheir mother used to tell me that the boy and the girl saw me like a spiritual brother, a replacement for the one they lost, a brother they looked up to and were proud of.\nToday, as I seat here, I wonder how the boy and the girl took it when I left them without saying goodbye. How could they\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with losing another brother?\nIt is a lot easier to walk this street now.\nI remember walking this long street one evening after class to attend the midweek meeting at the kingdom hall at Rimando Road. The traffic wasn\u0026rsquo;t moving so I got off the jeep and began walking. I arrived 15 minutes before the end the meeting.\nI look at my clock and see that it is now 9:16. Some buildings block the light giving shade to my walk\nI walk here no longer wearing polo, slacks, and leather shoes but a hooded sweater, shorts, and a pair of slippers. I walk here no longer as an evangelist Christian whose life is centered around learning and preaching a single way of looking at the world. I walk now as a photographer-writer looking for lights and different ways of seeing a things.\nAfter taking off my Christian clothes, I noticed that it was natural for me to avoid holding strong beliefs or convictions about anything. At school I struggled taking a stand or took a stand blindly for fear of ridicule. After school, I floated around different religious, political, and philosophical perspectives hoping for something to stick. Very little did.\nI was attracted to perspectives that aren\u0026rsquo;t black and white. Nuanced. Didn\u0026rsquo;t demand me to always take a stand. Didn\u0026rsquo;t demand me to fight for something before I fully understand it. Didn\u0026rsquo;t preach to me or belittled me for my ignorance. I avoided groups and people who behaved this way. This way of thinking represented everything I left. To honor the unique journey I\u0026rsquo;ve been dealt with, I had to resist the urge to be someone I\u0026rsquo;m not yet. If this means I take a less popular stand, so be it.\nI think I have earned the right to enjoy epistemological freedom a bit longer after I\u0026rsquo;ve offered a quarter of my life to a belief system that honored no such thing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve walked Rimando Road several times as a JW, but I was too consumed by religious thoughts. I\u0026rsquo;ve never stopped to even notice how clear a view it offers of Aurora Hill.\nI go down the stairs from Bonifacio Street and almost immediately see Aurora Hill. I stopped to stare at it for a while, looking for familiar places. I\u0026rsquo;m looking for Bayan Park, but perhaps it is hidden behind all those houses. What is visible are the still unoccupied areas of the hill that leads to Ambiong, the barangay of Baguio that connects with the caldera municipality of La Trinidad, Benguet.\nThe sight of Ambiong calms me down as I walk slowly down Rimando Road. I\u0026rsquo;m about to reach the end of the walk, where I\u0026rsquo;ll come face to face with one of the most challenging places to visit on this walk.\nCrossing the bridge over the Balili River, I begin to see the intersection of Rimando Road and Manuel Roxas Street, an intersection where the most defining events of my 16th, 17th, and 18th year occurred.\nAt this intersection, I met people who treated me like their own brother and son, people I thought I would grow old and die with. At this intersection, I first learned sign language—interpreted for people who were deaf and hard of hearing then later delivered full talks purely in sign language. At this intersection, I met a woman I would love even for just a very short time. Here, I learned faith, community, responsibility—things I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn enough back at home.\nI looked across the street and saw two establishments where I used to eat with my friends before and after meetings. In one of these establishments, while having dinner with friends, I watched a tsunami engulf vehicles and houses in Japan on March 11, 2011, the same day my depressive symptoms first appeared.\nAs I approached the kingdom hall, however, I felt unease. I stood outside 7-eleven and looked at it from afar. It is no longer the same building I knew. It was totally different thing.\nToday, three men wearing hard hats were walking around the building. They seem to be cleaning or repairing something. I recognize at least one of them. Remembering my promise not to take a photo of people I used to know in the church, I crossed the street to move to another side of the building away from the men.\nThis renovation only meant that the entire building was destroyed. In fact, the foundation of the old building, what was once a ground floor with a kitchen we used to hang out and rooms we took naps in, was destroyed. What is left is a hollow parking lot. The building still had two large halls, which means it could still accommodate the same number of congregations it used to support (perhaps even more). But it is no longer the old building made predominantly with wood, a building where people wearing leather shoes walking on the wooden second floor created a sound I can still hear as I write these words.\nI no longer recognize this building. It is something entirely new. As I am. We meet like strangers for the first time.\nAfter just a few minutes of staring at it, I decided I had done what I ought to do. I began walking back to where I came from.\nAs I walked, I took note of the unease I felt during this reunion, an unease borne not out of nostalgia but out of meeting something I barely recognize, something that isn\u0026rsquo;t that which would create nostalgia. I left early because there was nothing left for me there.\nThe people I loved in that kingdom hall, at least most of them, are now gone. And even if they\u0026rsquo;re still there, they won\u0026rsquo;t be the same people I fell in love with. As I am.\nI remind myself that I expect nothing out of these walks, like I expect nothing out of meditation. I\u0026rsquo;m not doing this to find closure or reconciliation. Not even reintegration. I do this with a complete openness to whatever arises.\nAs I crossed the bridge over the Balili River, I was reminded once more that this was another thing I failed to look closely at in the past. Throughout this walk, this was the time when I felt my camera calling. I picked it up and used its zoom not to take a good photo but to look at the river closely and with focus.\nWhile looking closely at the Balili River, I am reminded that I, too, am a river of sorts—ever-changing, ever-flowing. And this ever-flowing nature is what makes me who I am.\nThe years 2008–2012 were beautiful years that had to end dramatically. They had to end because without them ending, the river wouldn\u0026rsquo;t flow, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t change course, and would\u0026rsquo;ve stopped being a river. In other words, it would\u0026rsquo;ve stopped being itself.\n","date":"15 January 2024","permalink":"/tt1/001/","section":"Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1","summary":"","title":"Tall Tales Day 01 — First Walk"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;every breath is filled with champagne, and so invigorating that new blood seems to flow through my veins.\u0026rdquo; — Frank G. Carpenter, Through the Philippines and Hawaii, 1925.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;this climate always does wonders for me when I have been or am ill, and I do not see why it should not keep me well if I could have more of it.\u0026rdquo; — Dean Worcester (February 5, 1908, upon arriving in Baguio)\nWhen I consulted Louise Far about this project, she laid down a question I overlooked:\nHow are you going to protect yourself while doing it?\nStupid me. How could I have forgotten?\nAbout three months ago, an innocent walk along Magsaysay Avenue in Baguio City brought back memories from a distant past. I recounted the trigger in [[uman 2023-10|the October 2023 issue of 𝌡 Uman]]:\nWhile walking towards the Taoist temple carelessly called a “Church,” I passed by a restaurant that held memories. I have never been in this restaurant but my friends in the church and I used to kid about this particular place. It was one of the fanciest restaurants in Baguio ten years ago (perhaps it still is?) and we joked that one day we would treat each other there—one day, we would always say. For this very reason, we find the name of the restaurant particularly appropriate: “Future Diner.”\nI am yet to eat at Future Diner.\nHow fast a seemingly innocent walk can transport oneself into what is thought to be forgotten. On that walk, I started seeing things.\nOn my way back, I stopped at an intersection to let cars pass before I cross. A woman sitting at the back of a car looked at me eye to eye as the car passed in front of me. I think I knew this woman. I think I knew her very well.\nSuddenly, more memories of those three short but filled years in Baguio came rushing inside my head. “I can’t be here any longer. I can’t be here any longer,” I told myself as I walked briskly.\nThat walk led to feelings of regret (for leaving the church? for letting go of what could\u0026rsquo;ve possibly been a secure life around people who loved me? for hurting my parents?) and then of doubts (am I on the right path? is this life really better? is this freedom worth it?)\nThe questions were too much to bear. I was moved to [[2023 annual review|ask for \u0026ldquo;spiritual help\u0026rdquo; for the first time in twelve years]].\nWhy do the streets of Baguio have this power over me?\nI wrote an [[a never-ending walk|extended essay]] about my personal history of this place. But here\u0026rsquo;s a quick timeline for those who don\u0026rsquo;t have the time to read it or are reading me for the first time.\n2008: I left my hometown of San Jacinto, Pangasinan, to study at the University of the Philippines Baguio (UPB), which is about two hours away. While there, I transferred to a congregation with a large membership, many of whom were college students like me. This congregation also had a sign language group, which ministered to people who were deaf or hard of hearing. I joined the group and learned sign language between classes at the university. 2009: I grew deep in what was once the religion of my parents. I became very proficient in sign language and nurtured an affinity for the deaf community in Baguio. Around this time, the Governing Body of Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses started releasing talks and articles to its congregations worldwide warning about the dangers of higher education. My father, who was an elder at our congregation in Pangasinan, was persecuted by his colleagues for his decision to send me to college away from home. Listening to these talks and reading the articles made me doubt college. I was sure I wanted to dedicate my life to the ministry, dreaming of becoming a missionary to far-flung places, so I also questioned whether a degree in Social Sciences was necessary for my dream. Some friends in my new congregation in Baguio who also went to UPB have left and opted to take two-year technical-vocational courses instead. As days passed, I lost my desire to continue my studies, which was reflected in my grades. 2010: The sign language group I was a part of became a full-fledged separate congregation, and with it came my appointment as a ministerial servant, an assistant to the elders in the congregation. Aside from giving talks in the congregation, my main task was to create routes and maps that would help all members reach prospects who were deaf or hard of hearing, many of whom lived far from each other. This assignment made me familiar with the streets and barangays of Baguio City. As my devotion to my faith grew, so was my desire to leave college. After the first semester, I asked my father to allow me to leave college to focus on my ministry. Despite the tears, he rejected my plea. 2011: In the last week of my second semester in my third year in college, I started developing symptoms of what I would later learn was clinical depression. I was able to go through my final exams, but I was constantly tired and unable to sleep. Around April my symptoms were too difficult to hide I had to ask for help. Through the assistance of a school guidance counselor, my parents, and a few psychiatrists, I started feeling better, but my suicidal urges were intense. I had to leave school for an entire year and leave my congregation in Baguio to return to Pangasinan and fully recover. While recovering, I started to question the existence of a God who allowed me to suffer. At the height of my suicidal ideations, I intentionally committed an act considered a flagrant sin among JWs, which I told myself I would do before ending my own life. I committed the sin but avoided suicide. 2012: Elders inside my new congregation in Pangasinan and those in my previous congregation in Baguio learned about my mistake. They communicated to arrive at a reasonable punishment weighing the sin I committed against the clinical depression I just went through. After long talks and prayers, they concluded that a month of probation would be enough. I was relieved of my responsibilities, including giving talks, as part of my probation. A few days before I was reinstated, a visiting overseer overturned the initial punishment and removed me as a ministerial servant instead. These events led me to question the integrity and \u0026ldquo;divineness\u0026rdquo; of my church. A few weeks later, I decided to leave the JWs. Not all streets of Baguio are triggering, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t completely avoided the city. I actually returned to Baguio in 2013, finished my studies in 2014, and frequently returned to visit my sister and her family, where I\u0026rsquo;ll be staying during this week-long walk project.\nI feel comfortable walking in most parts of Baguio. But I noticed that, over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve avoided certain areas for fear of seeing people I once knew and remembering what it feels like to be in these places as someone I used to be.\nThe decision to revisit these places and, dare I say, \u0026ldquo;re-own\u0026rdquo; them is not a rushed decision. It started about two years ago when I began making peace with my past. These days, I continue to ask myself what really happened back then and what I can learn from that seldom-visited time in my life that could enrich my present existence and the path I\u0026rsquo;m treading. For someone who has tried so hard to forget about certain places and specific periods of his life, to say that this project and everything it represents is necessary for me to continue living is an understatement.\nSince that walk in October, I\u0026rsquo;ve been building the courage to do this walk. I\u0026rsquo;m corresponding with a pastor who is helping me identify the following steps to take in re-owning my spiritual life. I\u0026rsquo;ve also started practicing seiza meditation and deepening my contemplative photography practice through consultations with Louise. I\u0026rsquo;m ready to do this, but what else can I do to protect myself during the project?\nFirst, I\u0026rsquo;m changing the focus of the project from \u0026ldquo;remembering\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;returning and reimagining.\u0026rdquo; To do this, I need to treat these walks as a form of meditation in the Buddhist sense. This commitment means using the present moment as an anchor, specifically the physical act of walking toward these places and being on them. This \u0026ldquo;being in place\u0026rdquo; is my priority, making the project \u0026ldquo;process-first.\u0026rdquo; The product, that is, the artifacts of creation that would come from this process, namely text and images, comes only after \u0026ldquo;being in place.\u0026rdquo;\nTo help me picture how this approach could be applied in these walks, I listed a few rules of the walk.\nThe walks will only be performed within seven days, from January 15 to 21. The goal is to perform a minimum of four and a maximum of six walks. For a four-walk week, I\u0026rsquo;ll alternate four days of walking and three days of rest. For a six-walk week, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk for three days straight, take a day off, and continue with another three days of walking. I am allowed to stop the project at any point if I think any or all of the walks have been too emotionally and psychologically difficult. As much as I could, I would avoid commuting to and from the locations of these walks. The idea is to use walking itself to set me up for and cool me down from the walk proper of the day. When on the walk proper, I will stop in specific locations that would call to me and stay there for a while to be with the place. I will focus on looking and feeling the place as it is today. Memories would be anticipated, but during these meditations, they would be treated like thought clouds passing by, allowed to arrive as they are without judgment. I will return to the present moment as much as I could I would avoid writing during the walks to focus on experiencing the places unless a thought or memory calls strongly. The decision on when to record a thought or memory would be intuitively made at the moment it happens during the walk. There will be places I will intentionally take photographs of (for example, the Kingdom Hall I used to go to). For these places, I would look at them first, be with them, take them in as they are now, and only take a photo when I\u0026rsquo;ve seen how the place asks to be photographed. Again, when the camera is used in this scenario would be intuitively done at the moment it happens in the walk. Aside from the places I intend to photograph, I\u0026rsquo;ll take other photos of things or places that call me during the walk using the same process. The walks would be done in the morning. They would start around 6 or 7 and end around 11. I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking a few hours of rest after the walk. In the afternoons, I\u0026rsquo;ll write about the experience of the walks and the strongest memories that arose from them. Although not my main intention, I welcome ideas on how to relate to these places moving forward. In the evenings, I\u0026rsquo;ll process the photos I\u0026rsquo;ve taken and share a few of them in the email I send that day. To protect the privacy of the people I could be writing about, I won\u0026rsquo;t be using their real names or the names of the streets they live on. I also won\u0026rsquo;t be photographing the houses of people I used to know. In addition, I won\u0026rsquo;t be sharing a map of each walk; instead, I will share a single map of the entire project when it ends. One of the thoughts that came to me while discussing my initial plan for this project with Louise was that I could choose not to do it. I mean, this could potentially be a project I would regret doing. Many things can go wrong: the memories could come flooding even before the meditation begins, someone might recognize me, or I might ultimately not produce anything worth reading or looking at.\nBut I can feel the desire to do this in my veins. Also, it\u0026rsquo;s been twelve years. It\u0026rsquo;s about time.\nAs a subscriber to The Long Walk, you will automatically receive the missives (four to six of them, give or take).

In October 2022, the Batangueño poet, facilitator, and fellow pathfinder, Rem Tanauan, who I\u0026rsquo;m honored to call my dearest friend, died in his sleep at the age of 40, a week after spending a night with me at the launch of Saglit (A Moment), the latest book of the Philippines\u0026rsquo; foremost spiritual poet, Rofel Brion.\nA few weeks after Rem died, I received an email from the agency that has become my main source of freelance editing projects for the past three years informing me that I was cut from their roster of contractors. As a creative writer relying heavily on freelance editing projects to support myself and my artistic pursuits, receiving this email was undeniably painful. I had to drop all my other projects to focus on looking for work. It also meant that processing my grief for losing Rem had to wait.\nThis is the backdrop from which I began 2023. I entered the year thinking it would be the least creative and most boring of all my years. I was prepared to focus solely on making money and survival.\nOh, how wrong I was.\nThis is my 2023 annual review. While preparing it, I was surprised to learn that I\u0026rsquo;ve been writing annual reviews for almost a decade. It\u0026rsquo;s a practice I learned from the earliest bloggers that stuck with me through the years. I see each annual review as a cairn that marks a certain point in my long walk. Once in a while, when I\u0026rsquo;m feeling down or lost, I return to these cairns to see how much I\u0026rsquo;ve covered and how far I\u0026rsquo;ve come. These revisits often boost my confidence in my choices and the path I\u0026rsquo;m currently treading.\nIn the past couple of years, I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to experiment with the format of these reviews. Last year, I returned to a recap of each month of 2022. For my 2023 annual review, I\u0026rsquo;ll share the most important events of my year and some lessons I learned along the way.\nLive Simple, Trust Others #Tackling the loss of a major source of income in 2023 taught me two important lessons. First:\nIf you want to do important work, which isn\u0026rsquo;t immediately profitable, and you face some employment hurdles live as frugally as you can.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not like I don\u0026rsquo;t know this already. I grew up in a household with minimal means and a religion that preaches radical simplicity. I\u0026rsquo;ve embraced this radical simplicity and kept it as my own even after I left home and my childhood religion.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;ve never viscerally felt the wisdom of simple living until confronted an employment challenge when inflation was at an all-time high and the economy wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing well. I was surprised to see how many expenses I could cut to live even more simply without feeling deprived. Without losing that source of income, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t realize how much more money I could save and how much more time I could keep for the more important things in life. With this, I\u0026rsquo;m grateful.\nSecond:\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for work, the best place to search is your own existing network (i.e., friends, acquaintances, and previous employers).\nThis, of course, is not a secret. Almost all sound career advice books or articles will say this, and it is true. Looking for new clients through people who don\u0026rsquo;t know and trust you is tough. The day after receiving the severance email, I jumped into applying at other editing agencies. I did this for the entire month of January 2023. None of it worked.\nWhat saved me was a positive response to an email inquiry I sent to a previous boss. That kind human being offered me two editing projects that got me through the first three months of the year. When that ended, a research writing project referred by a friend, which I closed with some luck and hard work, got me going for another month. And when that ended, two friends with small businesses hired me to design and develop their websites. These two projects sustained me for more than half of the year.\nThese gigs kept me afloat until I started receiving a consistent flow of editing projects from my previous boss in the last quarter of the year. This financial stability allowed me to return to my studies, creative projects, and grief.\nContentment Through Faith #I burned the first three months of the year just doing freelance work. I was surviving, but my soul was beginning to suffer. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t reading at all. I wrote very little in my journals. I didn\u0026rsquo;t publish a single newsletter. I didn\u0026rsquo;t touch my camera. Only my daily evening walks reminded me that I\u0026rsquo;m called to do something other than ensure that I feed myself.\nThe Ateneo Institute of Literary Arts and Practices (AILAP) released a call for submissions for its 20th Ateneo National Writer\u0026rsquo;s Workshop (ANWW20) earlier in 2023. AILAP was particularly interested in essays that combined academic writing with literary, creative, and poetic writing. The deadline for submissions was April 1, 2023.\nThat date was at the back of my mind as I was wrapping up the last draft of a freelance writing project. I consider the essay, specifically the personal narrative essay, as my main creative writing form, and I was interested in how I could combine research and literary writing in my work, so attending AILAP\u0026rsquo;s workshop made a lot of sense.\nHowever, I only finished writing the client\u0026rsquo;s paper ten days before AILAP\u0026rsquo;s deadline. My brain was already fried from all the research and writing I had done for the past three weeks, so I doubted whether I could write anything worth sending to AILAP.\nI was ready to let it go, but the fear of regret was too much to bear. The fact that I had just managed to write a paper for a client in just ten days was also staring me in the face. If I could do it, what\u0026rsquo;s another ten days of writing? So, I decided to give it a shot. I told myself, whatever comes out of me in ten days, I\u0026rsquo;ll send it to AILAP.\nI got right to work. I decided to write about something I already know and incorporate writings I already have in my journals and website. The topic was easy: I will write about walking, specifically the long walk I did from Los Baños to San Pablo City in June 2022. I will explore the questions that that walk provoked, namely, \u0026ldquo;Why was I walking?\u0026rdquo; and mine my journals for answers.\nSince AILAP requires work that uses a theory, I looked for something in the literature and discovered autoethnography. I used autoethnography to talk about walking, how walking can be used as an alternative method for research, particularly researching oneself, and how all of these tie up to me leaving my childhood religion and using walking to cope with it.\nOne evening, while walking around the buildings of the Department of Forestry in the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) and thinking about the outline of the essay I\u0026rsquo;ll write, I caught myself using the word \u0026ldquo;faith\u0026rdquo; to describe what I\u0026rsquo;m doing. To pursue a creative project due in ten days after three weeks of working for money at a time when my financial security is still questionable, I told myself, is an act of faith. \u0026ldquo;Faith\u0026rdquo; is one of several words (including God, spiritual, and religious) that I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to avoid since leaving the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses in 2012. Now, like my religious past, I\u0026rsquo;m forced to confront this word, question my aversion to it, and think of the possibility of reintegrating it into my daily language.\nOn April 1, with much faith, I managed to put together a five-thousand-word entry, which I happily sent to AILAP. About three weeks later, I received an email from AILAP telling me that my entry landed me a seat as a fellow at the ANWW20, where I was joined by seven other young writers from different parts of the Philippines in three days of intense workshop.\nANWW20 is the most crucial event that defined my creative writing practice in 2023. It allowed me to have a glimpse of the Filipino literary community, learn about genres and subjects that remain unexplored in Filipino literature (two of which I know I could fill: nature writing and spiritual writing), and receive feedback on my writing from seasoned and published Filipino authors. Perhaps, more importantly, it allowed me to finally confront my past as an ex-JW minister through creative writing and share my story through a thirty-minute presentation in front of a group of strangers, a feat that by itself took a lot of courage and faith.\nThree months later, as if once isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, I re-encountered the word faith albeit in a more direct intellectual manner. This encounter came through the meditation timer I use.\nBefore the first practice of the day begins, the timer launches a question: \u0026ldquo;How are you feeling?\u0026rdquo; Below the question are several smileys for an answer. When I\u0026rsquo;m feeling okay, I tap on the smiling smiley. After I do this, a second screen appears, asking for reasons behind the answer (e.g., relationship, health, finances, etc.) and more specific words to describe my state of mind. One of the words available to tap is the word \u0026ldquo;content.\u0026rdquo; Since 2023 started, I have never tapped this word. I reasoned that I was in the middle of fixing many things in my life, so how could I be content?\nThat month, I was reading the essay \u0026ldquo;Presence, Memory, and Faith\u0026rdquo; by Steven E. Webb from Wilderness and the Heart, a book about Henry Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s philosophy. In that essay, Steven discusses how Bugbee connected fishing with faith.\nFishing stands for the life of faith, and the leaping fish stands for those exclamatory experiences—perceptual, mnemonic, or both—that may supervene upon that life. Apart from our active commitment to what the river may bestow, we would never cast our lines and the fish would never leap. This does not mean that the fish must leap. We can\u0026rsquo;t control their presence, and if we seek for control we shall reduce our lives to continual frustration. Faith, like fishing, has the somewhat oxymoronic character of active waiting—of keeping oneself open to whatever may come. Thus wanting a saving experience at the end of one\u0026rsquo;s days not only indicates an unwholesome fixation on something one can\u0026rsquo;t finally possess, but is quite beside the point. The issue is not the availability or durability of such experiences as isolated moments, but rather what they confirm, if and when they do occur, about the \u0026ldquo;omnirelevant truth\u0026rdquo;—affirmed and kept in faith—that our world is a holy place, that things are worthy of love, and that our life together with them is affirmable even in our moments of obscurity, and even as we perish.\nReflecting on these words, I realized I could find contentment in every moment, regardless of the situation, even when things aren\u0026rsquo;t okay. I could do this by believing that things will turn out fine eventually or that there are good things in the world, even if my present situation isn\u0026rsquo;t something I want. In other words, contentment is always a choice. I can be contented no matter the situation as long as I have faith in the goodness lurking behind everything.\nAsk for Help, Be Surprised #I\u0026rsquo;ve always found it difficult to ask for help. Asking for help involves trusting others, and that, too, is quite consistently a challenge for me. Perhaps this is something I learned growing up in a family where both parents didn\u0026rsquo;t check on their children as often as they should\u0026rsquo;ve. This tendency to be overly self-reliant and skeptical of other people\u0026rsquo;s help was exacerbated by my decision to leave my childhood religion. Awakening to the possibility that I may have wasted a quarter of my life in an organization that has manipulated and perhaps even abused me further reduced whatever level of trust I have in institutions and strangers. I\u0026rsquo;ve resisted being mentored or taught directly by anyone for years, and the right archetypes haven\u0026rsquo;t really appeared.\nI would later learn that self-reliance can only get one so far. We will always be interconnected with others, so whether we like it or not, we will always need their help. I experienced this immediately while looking for work in 2023. But this lesson became ever more true in two other areas of my life: art and spirituality.\nSince it was my first writers\u0026rsquo; workshop on a national scale, I feared that my lack of formal training would prevent me from participating effectively in the discussions at the ANWW20. After receiving news of my acceptance, I immediately contacted several friends and acquaintances who are already seasoned writers or have previously attended similar workshops. They all returned my messages promptly and were willing and excited to share their expertise and experiences. Three of these friends, in particular, provided detailed and practical advice that calmed my nerves and helped me focus on my most important job in the workshop: to be myself.\nAll of them told me to relax, enjoy the workshop, and trust that my co-fellows and the panelists would all be mature enough to show me mutual respect and give me what I need to improve as a writer. One of them told me I just had to be myself, do what I was already doing, and contribute to making the workshop safe for me and my fellow participants. Everything they said came true. All my co-fellows and panelists were kind and helpful in giving comments and criticisms. Everyone sought to create a safe space for all of us budding writers. Without these friends\u0026rsquo; encouragement and practical advice, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I would\u0026rsquo;ve taken full advantage of a rare opportunity such as the ANWW20.\nA day before the workshop, I met with Louise Far, whom I met a few months ago over a dinner with friends at Los Baños. Louise is a biography worker who also practices contemplative photography.\nDuring our initial dinner, I told Louise about my desire to write a book about my walks in Los Baños and how I wanted to include photographs. I told her that I recently lost my primary source of income, which made it challenging to start the project. She then shared how she faced similar hurdles while creating Inahan sa Sugilanon, her photobook about her years of stay in a Steiner-inspired green school community in Davao City, Mindanao. Finishing that project, she said, required leaps of faith that provided her with opportunities to experience kindness and grace from others.\nThat initial conversation made a mark on me, and I liked how Louise approached photography, so I asked if we could meet before my workshop at Ateneo. She generously accepted my invitation and gave me an entire afternoon where she shared more details about her story and specific advice on how I could show up more authentically during the workshop. That conversation and the advice I received from my friends earlier got me through a challenging three days. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve always seen Louise as an archetype for my photography and the creative and spiritual life I\u0026rsquo;m trying to walk.\nI should\u0026rsquo;ve already known that the walk would change something in me like walks often do, and yet I walked Magsaysay Ave. in Baguio City in October 2023, expecting nothing other than finding that highly rated Middle Eastern restaurant. I got home that afternoon feeling down and filled with doubts about the path I\u0026rsquo;d chosen. Worse, I felt inadequate compared to what I could\u0026rsquo;ve been had I never left, had I stayed more than ten years ago in Baguio city, still walking the same streets as a JW minister to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. I was surprised by what an innocent walk could do to my psyche. I realized that a decade of burying my past hasn\u0026rsquo;t worked for me. Avoidance and fear, partners I thought I could consistently rely on, have now shown their true colors.\nThe sadness I felt persisted even after I left Baguio. I feared that another bout of depression would come. I started to worry. That was when I knew I could no longer bear the burden of the past alone. That was when I knew I could no longer live the life of a solitary walker, walking the long and never-ending spiritual wilderness with no signs of reprieve. That was when I knew I needed help.\nAsk and you shall receive. Reprieve finally came in the person of Andrew James Brown, the non-theist Unitarian minister of a small, liberal, and free religious community in Cambridge, United Kingdom. I\u0026rsquo;ve written about Andrew many times in my writings in 2023, and even I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been repetitive. But this untiring mention of his influence on me at this point in my life illustrates how much I love and appreciate his work.\nSince reaching out to Andrew in October 2023 and continuously working with him, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a new daily spiritual practice (seiza), which I continue to deepen through the assistance of a similarly unique and gentle human being, Miki Nakura. I\u0026rsquo;m now more comfortable using the words I once avoided, such as faith, spirituality, and religion. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to own these words and customize their meanings to fit how I want to use them in my life. I\u0026rsquo;m also excited more than ever to explore and express my individual, unique kind of spirituality. I\u0026rsquo;m also more open to exploring practicing spirituality around others, perhaps even in a supporting community, with people like Andrew.\nMore importantly, I\u0026rsquo;m braver now. I feel like there is nothing to run away from, nothing to bury under the ground, just things to go toward. What I\u0026rsquo;m feeling now as I\u0026rsquo;m writing these words is the exact opposite of what I felt three months ago after walking in Baguio City, and this is the reason why I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to schedule a week-long walk of Baguio this January to intentionally confront my past finally by walking the streets where all of it happened after more than a decade later.\nJust Take the Next Step #If it isn\u0026rsquo;t clear by now, the biggest theme of my 2023 was \u0026ldquo;faith.\u0026rdquo; That word, which I\u0026rsquo;ve tried so hard to erase from my psyche, is exactly what I had to relearn multiple times this year.\nIn one of his articles, Andrew likened faith to simply taking the next step. Using a scene from an Indiana Jones film, which I can no longer forget, Andrew explains why faith is essential even among liberal individuals.\n\u0026hellip;within liberal social, political and religious circles we have increasingly been losing the ability to make any kind of leap of faith. Faith has for us become almost entirely replaced by a reliance on positive knowledge and technology which, alas, has also helped create the dream that, somehow, all danger of injury can be removed from the world. In consequence, we have become pathologically risk-averse and cannot move forward because we are caught in a loop of looking and looking and looking, again and again and again. All this looking IS fine, of course, when the looking really can provide us with useful information about the best way to proceed, but what about those situations, those existential situations, when no further looking can deliver the answer we need if we are to continue living well and with genuine hope?\nAndrew concludes:\n\u0026hellip;although we can (and at times we will all) look \u0026ldquo;if we like\u0026rdquo; to try to discern the difficulties and dangers ahead before we leap, there will always-already come those times when we \u0026ldquo;will have to leap\u0026rdquo; without knowing what comes next because what comes next cannot be known beforehand.\nThis leaping, this taking the next step, resonates with me well because of my undeniable love of walking. In my life, walking has evolved from being a mode of evangelization to becoming a means for contemplation and, later, a platform for creation. In recent years, walking has also become a metaphor, which I\u0026rsquo;ve used to make sense of other pursuits, such as studying or reading, and even life itself (i.e., the long walk). Using walking language (e.g., \u0026ldquo;take the next step\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;leap\u0026rdquo;) to help me re-learn faith has been excellent. Every time I take a walk these days, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but see it as a practice of faith—faith that as long as I remain true to myself, I\u0026rsquo;ll be alright; faith that despite the myriad of reasons and pressure to hurt me, my fellow human beings will show me kindness; and faith that behind all the suffering in the world is the potential for compassion to flourish.\nIn April 2023, through the invitation of Ili Likhaan, a small art business run by a good friend, I had the privilege of leading two groups of remarkable individuals in a guided, structured walk along a route inside UPLB, which I found during one of my afternoon walks. I called the walks Nasa Labas ang Ili (NLAI, \u0026ldquo;Home is Outdoors\u0026rdquo;) and did one before sunset (Dapit-hapon) and after sunrise (Bukang-liwayway) on different days. Conducting the NLAI walks was a walk of faith because my walks had largely been solitary before this. After using walks to grieve and to find myself after leaving my childhood religion, I\u0026rsquo;ve become a firm believer in the power of walking to transform individuals \u0026ldquo;alone,\u0026rdquo; and perhaps because of this, I doubted whether walking with others could have a similar effect. If any, walking with others might hinder an individual\u0026rsquo;s pursuit of listening to oneself.\nOf course, after taking a leap of faith, I saw that my initial fears were unfounded. I divided the walk into three segments. Each segment was an opportunity for each of the walkers to focus their attention on one subject. The subjects were kapwa (neighbor), pook (place), and sarili (self). By pairing participants who met for the first time in the first segment, walking was transformed into a communion with neighbors unlike any other I\u0026rsquo;ve witnessed. After just a few minutes, walkers who were complete strangers just moments ago were laughing, sharing stories, and listening deeply. One of the participants even told me he doesn\u0026rsquo;t usually loosen up around strangers, let alone reveal stuff about himself the way the walk helped him do.\nCha Domingo, chef, writer, and activist who joined one of these walks, shared her experience.\nIn the second part of our walk, we arrived at a field and it was revealed that this time would be used to rest “however that feels like to you.” We sat on the grass, some laid down and took naps, and others took photos. I idled in awkwardness thinking but I’m not tired yet!\nThis is how I came to the realization that I never anticipate or plan for rest in any aspect of my life. As a chef, I was conditioned to operate on the perfectionist premise of leaving no task unfinished. In the kitchen we do as much prep as we can to be able to clock out earlier. The signifier for me to take a break was that I felt tired, and even while on break I couldn’t allow myself to relax because I was preoccupied with the same task I had just stepped away from.\nThe way that Vince structured our program helped me unlock a new application for rest; how the mere addition of a purposeful break can add depth to any experience. It seems like a shallow observation but often times we’re too caught up in our routines and rely solely on instinct to tell us when to pause. I now understand that tiredness is an indication that I’ve already surpassed my capacity, which is never a good state to foster anything meaningful.\nA few weeks before 2023 ended, I once more learned faith through walking. Before 2023 began, I wanted to do at least one week-long walk of Los Baños to take photos of the town and write about it. This is fieldwork, a way to collect data I would later use to write the book about Los Baños I\u0026rsquo;ve been telling myself (and my friends) I will write. Because of the difficulties I mentioned above, I postponed the walk many times in 2023.\nBy December, I\u0026rsquo;d started to regain my financial footing and felt better about my spirituality, so I considered doing the walk before the year ended. I set the date: December 4 to 10. I released posters on social media announcing it to people. I wrote and sent email invites to my email list. It was my first time doing a project like this, and I was learning as I went. The biggest challenge came with the weather. Before December 4, Los Baños has experienced daily almost non-stop rains. Weather predictions say the week of the walk won\u0026rsquo;t be different. And yet, I was determined to do the walk. I told myself I\u0026rsquo;ve been through so much this year to get to this point where I can walk, write, and photograph for an entire week. I\u0026rsquo;ll do it, I said, rain or shine.\nGuess what. December 4 to 10 was one of the driest weeks of Los Baños in 2023. I walked in the mornings, with no rain, and could take several decent photos. I went home by lunch, rested briefly, then wrote in the afternoon. In the evenings, I culled and edited the photos before sending the emails to those following the walk. Roots x Gravel (what I called the project) is the single thing that I was happiest completing in 2023. Going through all those challenges last year to do the walk made me appreciate its completion even more.\nBefore Rem died, I often wondered how he could radiate so much faith to the world and others. He would often use the words \u0026ldquo;I surrender\u0026rdquo; when referring to things beyond his control, then finds peace in trusting that everything will eventually turn out okay no matter what. His faith in others, while still measured, is often brimming, and I feel like he just can\u0026rsquo;t help but greet everyone he meets with a smile and a gesture of complete trust. No wonder his funeral took almost two weeks, and his eulogy took two days to end. So many people wanted to share how they were touched by the kindness and genuine care of this one-of-a-kind human being.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered why I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be the same. I asked why I couldn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have the same faith in myself, others, and the world, a faith which my closest friend so effortlessly radiated every day.\nAfter 2023, I feel I\u0026rsquo;m at least one step closer to understanding faith. If he were still alive today, Rem would\u0026rsquo;ve been the first person to know everything about it.\n","date":"5 January 2024","permalink":"/essays/2023-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"2023 Annual Review"},{"content":"When we entered Raymundo Gate, a girl wearing a cap, a shirt, and leggings stood on the side of Velasco Ave. It\u0026rsquo;s now almost six, and the light just broke out after a long night.\nTwo other youngsters walked toward our direction. Pieces of tarp held by golden pins hung on the front of their shirts. The tarps had numbers printed on them, and one of the teenagers handed a tarp to the girl waiting on the side of the road.\n\u0026ldquo;Make haste. The race would begin soon,\u0026rdquo; I told my partner.\nWe walked Aglibut Ave., Cuzner Ave., Mondonedo Ave., and Roxas Street faster than usual before passing by the Vet Med buildings that would take us to the Copeland Gymnasium in no time. From afar, we heard upbeat music frequently interrupted by the cheery voices of two hosts.\n\u0026ldquo;Fur babies and their parents, the race is starting in ten minutes!\u0026rdquo; a host announced. Our steps got faster.\nWe signed up for the one-kilometer pet race because we wanted to bring Carillon, the calico kitten (now a full-grown cat) that we picked up from the Carillon Tower just a few meters away last year. Carillon was too afraid to leave the house, so we decided to join our friends, who were bringing their two dogs with them to the race.\nThat morning was hands down one of the best mornings of my life. From the moment we arrived around six until we left about eight in the morning, the smile on my face never faded. Being surrounded by that many dogs of different sizes and breeds made me feel something genuine and unpretentious—something I\u0026rsquo;ve never felt in a long time. Interestingly, the owners, who were as diverse as their dogs, all seemed to be kind and beautiful human beings. Everyone was approaching everyone, asking about their fur babies, stroking every pet\u0026rsquo;s fur, and smiling, just smiling.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not a morning person, but I\u0026rsquo;m delighted I woke up early.\nDecember 2023, the last month of a good year, was filled with opportunities to commune with strangers and to experience through this communion something similar to what I felt that morning.\nRoots ྾ Gravel #From December 4 to 10, 2023, I finally did a project I had postponed long enough: a week-long walk around Los Baños. I walked for six days, taking a day off on December 6, when I noticed that my feet were aching and needed to rest. Ultimately, I took 114,814 steps to cover 72.59 kilometers, including 87 streets in 13 barangays.\nIn the email I sent to invite people to follow along with the walks, I articulated the rationale of the project:\nI’m doing this to honor Los Baños for everything it has given me for the past three years. This is one of the few places in the Philippines where I felt like people actually cared about their neighbors and the place they inhabit. It is the perfect place to explore the subsistent spirituality I’ve been writing about recently and see how this place shapes the life I’ve been trying to build here.\nThe missives (text + photographs) of that seven-day walk of Los Baños is archived here.\nA few days after concluding the project, I reflected on how it affected me regarding writing, photography, and walking. In my journal, I wrote:\nThe walks made me a better photographer. They got me better acquainted with my camera. I feel more familiar with it. I have understood what parts of it I still need to learn to use better. I now know I need to learn more about lenses, make a better call about when to use a specific ISO, and tweak the aperture when necessary.\nThe walks also helped me become a better writer. They did so by showing me what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Writing about an experience while still fresh has generated promising results. I got into flow writing in the late afternoon, making me wonder whether to tweak my schedule and do something similar: engage with the world in the morning and write in the afternoon or evening.\nI also learned a lot about my body\u0026rsquo;s limits, especially regarding walking. Even if it was just seven days, it was beyond what my body could do. If I do another one, I need to be in better shape: eat right, sleep right. I also need to tweak the process and schedule based on what I can do. Perhaps longer rests? Alternate walking and days of rest?\nOne of the many challenges of walking, especially on busy roads, is sharing the roads and the sidewalks (if they\u0026rsquo;re available) with others, both fellow pedestrians and motorists. Years ago, I wrote [[pagpapaubaya|a meditation]] (in Filipino) about the practice of \u0026ldquo;giving way\u0026rdquo; to others whom we meet on the road. I see now that sharing the road with others as a walker is a practice of patience and, dare I say, love, that I always find difficult—too difficult that I had to articulate [[some rules on sharing the road with others|some rules on sharing the road with others]] that I read once in a while when triggered by road behavior that irritates me. Interestingly, I noticed that I was less triggered when walking for hours and being around vehicles and pedestrians for longer than usual during this week-long walk of Los Baños.\nDuring Roots x Gravel, I walked all but one barangay of Los Baños: Bagong Silang. About two weeks after the project ended, I published an essay about my first solo walk of Bagong Silang last November 2023. That essay was entitled \u0026ldquo;[[and i shall hear their hearts beating|And I Shall Hear Their Hearts Beating]].\u0026rdquo;\nPhotographic Re-walking #Because I put a lot of time into my writing in 2023, my photography has suffered. Roots x Gravel allowed me to return to photography, practice the craft, and rethink my systems. With my photo library growing because of these walks, a photo backup system should be in place. After listening to advice online, I invested in a 2TB Sandisk external SSD to serve as the primary storage of my photo archive. I then backed this archive up in the cloud through my Backblaze account.\nNext, I invested several hours going through my existing photographs, culling the albums, adding metadata, adding keywords, adding GPS coordinates, and renaming the best ones. While doing these, I had to return to photographs I took last year during [[a never-ending walk|my long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo]]. Returning to these photographs, I noticed, was almost like re-walking that route. Especially when fixing the GPS coordinates of the photos, I learned new things about the walk I never knew before, such as what barangays I passed by during the walk.\nWith the help of a mentor, I was also able to think about ways to print my photos and what lenses to consider buying for future projects. In photography, as in writing and spirituality, a good archetype to follow, such as a mentor, a friend, or a teacher, could accelerate the deepening of one\u0026rsquo;s practice.\nWalking as Intersectional #One of the feedback I got from [[anww20|ANWW20]] was that I should begin thinking about \u0026ldquo;others\u0026rdquo; when writing about my walks, not necessarily integrate them into my writing but just think about them. These others share the roads I use but are of a different gender, disability status, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, etc. Aside from these, I should also begin thinking about the many others who don\u0026rsquo;t walk because of physical disability or the current social structures that make physical spaces unsafe for them.\nSome months ago, I mentioned on [[uman 2023-10|this newsletter]] that I was working with a fellow writer on exploring the walking methodology through epistolary essays. I spent a significant chunk of my December in dialogue with her regarding the intersectional nature of walking and how we, as writers, could bring this sensitivity to intersectionality into our works.\nIn one of the emails I sent to my collaborator, I wrote the following:\nOne\u0026rsquo;s location on the landscape is not just a physical point. It\u0026rsquo;s an intersection where norms, history, gender, and other social categories converge. In short, the walking method is inescapably intersectional. When I\u0026rsquo;m standing at the intersection of Espino Street and Mondonedo Street inside UPLB, I see artifacts of colonialism (Baker Hall and the half of Freedom Park surrounding the fertility tree). This was once the Japanese internment camp. And yet today, the same spaces are used for events, and people go here for recreation. So, these spaces are socio-historical. Even when walking alone, I\u0026rsquo;m never truly by myself. I\u0026rsquo;m surrounded by reminders of the past, which now bring reconstructed meanings and new narratives we\u0026rsquo;ve attached to them. When I walk in these spaces, I cut through their meanings with my own multiple layers of meaning: my gender, my multiple disabilities, my spiritual and religious background, my regional identity, etc. So, a writer who chooses a walking method can never escape these layers and intersections. Even if they don\u0026rsquo;t write explicitly about these subjects, since they walk on multi-layered grounds, they must consider them at least while executing their project. But this also means that since walking is rigorously intersectional, a work borne through it will most likely be complex, which warrants a multi-layered reading. Our letters can never be about one thing.\nThings Become Other Things #If you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading me for a while, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that I often reference [[craig mod|Craig Mod]]. While I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing around with writing and photography throughout my 20s and I\u0026rsquo;ve been a walker for as long as I can remember, Craig\u0026rsquo;s work introduced me to the possibility of combining writing, photography, and walking into a single art practice. I wrote about [[good art reorganizes your world|how I encountered him back in 2021]]. I\u0026rsquo;ve studied his work closely in the past three years by reading as many of his newsletters as I could manage, studying his systems and practices as a member of his Special Projects membership program, and reading his first book [[kissa by kissa mod|Kissa by Kissa]].\nThis December, Craig released the first edition of his second book [[things become other things mod|Things Become Other Things]]. I read Craig primarily to study craft (vignette writing, photography, and text + image juxtaposition), and this is what I did for a good chunk of December, particularly the last week before Christmas. Every morning, I spent a couple of hours reading a few chapters and taking note of a few things I learned.\nOne of the creative writing strategies employed repeatedly in TBOT is related to something I mentioned above about walking—how a walk is innately intersectional. Craig writes several of his vignettes using a version of the following formula:\nHe describes the landscape he is walking. He focuses his description on a specific person, place, or object in the landscape. He finds a story around that subject by remembering his personal experiences, citing information from his interviews with people he met along the road, or sharing tidbits from the books he had read about the place. He then wraps up the vignette with a witty, poetic conclusion that ties everything together. Here\u0026rsquo;s a sample of one of his shorter vignettes, which illustrates the formula:\nImmutable Stuff\nWhen I imagine the peninsula as a god itself, I see a creature for whom it\u0026rsquo;s as easy to summon a thing into being as it is for us to say a word. The peninsula desires a shack and by that desire — of earth and rock and worm and leech — a shack manifests. The peninsula desires an abandoned barn, and there it is, as it always has been, for as long as the peninsula wants it to be.\nAs a kid, the whole world felt preordained, immutable. Everything about the old town simply was, always had been, and always would be. There was no old town without Bryan. Of course he was there. Of course we met. This was the way it was meant to happen. Some God of airplane engine factories ordained it, and thus from the tobacco fields we rose.\nOverall, TBOT was a beautiful and instructive book to read, and anyone who aspires to write about and through walking would find it an excellent addition to their library. It gave me some ideas on how to approach my walking projects moving forward, including a book about my walks in Los Baños, which I hope to start writing this 2024, and a walk around Baguio City, which I plan on doing a few days from now.\n","date":"2 January 2024","permalink":"/uman/014/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 014 — December 2023"},{"content":"Bagong Silang is the last barangay of Los Baños, Laguna, before the ascent to Mount Makiling. It covers the first few stations of the Mount Makiling Trail, Aguila base, and a couple more kilometers beyond. It was the only barangay I missed walking during my week-long walk of Los Baños two weeks ago. Here is a lyric essay of my first solo walk in this barangay last November.\nThe clouds were moving too fast I had to stop to watch them. I raised my head and my eyes followed their gray outlines. Where are they going and why do they hurry?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAt the mouth of Mount Makiling Trail, cracking sounds subtly break the silence I\u0026rsquo;ve only just found. They seem to come from above. It was the sound of broken wood—branches yielding to the November wind. An entire branch, longer than both my arms combined, fell on the spot I just walked on. I moved to the middle of the road and stood still to listen to the surrounding collapse.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nFor a moment, I felt I already had what I came here for. I felt that I no longer had to walk. I just had to stand completely still under these prodigious timber, and I shall hear their hearts beating.\nOr was that mine?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nFrom where I stand, I hear the chorus of insects. Trills ascending, then descending. From where I stand, I too hear the distant sound of a chainsaw. Metal ripping air. Then wood. Ever ascending, never descending. As if ready to devour the forest.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOn the left side of the trail, two large stumps lay still, each the size of a round table. Once foot of giants, they refuse to be broken. They stand even in death.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIt is only here where I truly feel closer to everything else. Such is the paradox of a solitary walk in nature.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMy walk is changed by the subtle positioning of my eyes. Staring at the road ahead, I feel sanguine yet exhausted. Looking up, I feel impassioned yet small. Looking down, I feel placid yet constricted.\nSometimes, I wish I could walk with my eyes closed.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nOn this trail, to look down on the ground while walking is to look at decay and death: a dead earthworm, a decomposing bird, a wet frog skin with innards bursting. Of course, fallen branches and dried leaves. This walk is long, but like these things, it too shall end.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nA wild chicken appeared out of nowhere. Hearing me coming, it went straight back to the underbrush where it may have come from.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI remembered that once, these walks never gave me anything in return, never rewarded the rigor I devoted to them. I remembered realizing that these walks too are walked. Past the initial hump, as if finally trusting the walker, the walks bestowed upon me the awareness that I have a body, that there is so much going on within and outside it, and that if I keep trusting the next step, only the next step, anything and everything that meets me on the road, whatever they would be, shall be and always will be part of me.\n","date":"16 December 2023","permalink":"/tlw/026/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"And I Shall Hear Their Hearts Beating: A Walk at Bagong Silang"},{"content":" Roots x Gravel is done!

Makiling is a colossal rock not to be climbed by the weak of heart. Likewise, Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines, sustaining many generations of fisherfolk across several provinces. It is so large that locals call it dagat (sea), not lake.\nI remembered ilaya and ilawod while entering the smaller branch of Jamboree Road, which would lead me to the camping site of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines. After immersing in the sound of waves crashing the hull of fishing boats yesterday, I welcome the soft, gentle singing of an unfamiliar bird, broken only by this helicopter that just passed by.\nI stopped for a while to study the light here under these trees. Not much light enters the canopy about 20 to 30 feet above me, so I’m amazed at the lush vegetation growing on the floor. Not even my camera could eat enough light here. I was forced to tweak my camera settings to capture photos. And yet, this short road segment just before the bridge is full of vigor and life. Making do with what light I found, I crossed the bridge and continued walking.\nI heard a child calling from across the hill as I approached the first settlement. Suddenly, his calls were swallowed by the deafening explosion of a firecracker. A woman tending to her garden nearby didn\u0026rsquo;t seem bothered by the blast.\nHere at ilaya, I noticed that moments of deep silence occur more often. Even in between the explosion of a firecracker, one could find this silence. I think that this silence is enduring because of the forest. The bushes, the vines, and the towering trees embrace me as I walk, and I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve entered a capsule of wood and leaves that insulate me from the outside world.\nWhenever I\u0026rsquo;m overwhelmed by the sound of the streets, even by the monotony inside my room, I walk toward Mt. Makiling and cling to her limbs, where I might hear that voice fading within me once more.\nWalking on ilaya today, I hear my voice even when I hear the cutting of grasses. I hear it even as I ask these boys what they\u0026rsquo;re reaching on a high branch of a young tree. Spiders, one of them said. Then why are you hunting them while in your best clothes? I asked. Aren\u0026rsquo;t you going to church? No, they said. We\u0026rsquo;re not going to church.\nIt has probably been over a year since I last walked Jamboree Road. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure I never set foot on this path the previous year. The last time I walked here alone, it was night. I started walking on the same track but began late in the afternoon. When I finished my first tour of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines camping site and entered the larger Jamboree Road, it was really dark. Fortunately, it was a full moon, and the sky was clear. The moon shining beautifully was enough to make that walk magical. But the small lights on the floor of the road made that walk even spellbinding. No vehicle passed by for more than 30 minutes, and the road was left for me alone. I walked to the side, but my eyes were fixated on the lights. It was like walking on top of a dark sky guided by stars.\nSomeone built a cafe on Jamboree Road. It is the only large establishment here. Being among shanties and fruit stalls, it definitely seems out of place. A sign on their door says the cafe should be open now. Instead, I saw the quietest and emptiest chunk of concrete ever.\nI started this series of walks with a question: What sustains me in Los Baños?\nHere, while sitting on Jamboree Road overlooking Laguna de Bay and the fishing communities I visited in the previous days, I asked myself whether I\u0026rsquo;d found any good answer to that question. Perhaps even more importantly, could any of the answers be articulated in words?\nThe images I saw and the tiny encounters I had throughout these six walks around Los Baños gave me the feeling that my friendship with this place was rekindled, if not deepened. Also, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;ve been instructed about something, even if I\u0026rsquo;m still unsure what it is. What I\u0026rsquo;m sure of is that these walks helped me see why I chose to stay in Los Baños long enough to call it my home.\nLos Baños is the only place I\u0026rsquo;ve stayed longer than three years, which isn\u0026rsquo;t named Baguio or San Jacinto. It is difficult for me to take root and find a home away from the familiar north, so to have this connection with Los Baños is not something I take lightly.\nThese walks helped me realize that Los Baños has given me a place where I could safely and freely embody my current state of liminality. Through its streets, roads, and dirt paths under the thick foliage of trees, between rice paddies, beside calm waters, and under century-old buildings, it has given me a safe space to doubt and question my previous beliefs about the world and myself. It has given me a place to retreat, rest, and rejuvenate as I walk in my spiritual wilderness. Through its ilaya, it reminds me that I\u0026rsquo;m a unique individual aspiring for freedom, and through its ilawod, it reminds me that I could be free only when my neighbor is also free.\nLos Baños is no longer just the random place I transported myself in 2021, almost in haste during a pandemic. It has become a true ili, a home, the center from which I could launch whatever walks I aspire to in the coming days. And like any ili, it is a place I could always return to after a long walk.\nI greeted him and held his left arm when he seemed too shaky to stand. I asked him to move closer to me as the vehicles behind him were too fast. He was all smiles when I asked him, louder than usual so he could hear me in the middle of all this traffic noise.\n\u0026ldquo;Grandpa, where are you going?\u0026rdquo; I asked.\nHe uttered a place I didn\u0026rsquo;t catch.\nLetting go of his arm, I asked him another question.\n\u0026ldquo;Why are you walking by yourself at this age?\u0026rdquo;\nHe looked at me for a second, then pointed at his watch.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s still early.\u0026rdquo;\nI laughed and told him to take care as we went our separate ways.\nJamboree Road → Manila South Road (Timugan, Anos)\n15,101 steps 7.44 km\n","date":"10 December 2023","permalink":"/rxg1/007/","section":"Roots ྾ Gravel (R྾G)","summary":"","title":"(RxG) Day 07 Ilaya, Ilawod"},{"content":"December 09, 2023\nWhen the Wardaman people of Australia walk for days on end to move in groups, they sing. Their songs speak of stories attached to places in the landscape. These songs, they say, mirror songs about specific spots in the sky. The songs are maps through which the Wardaman people remember exact locations and the events and myths attached to them. Bruce Chatwin was the first to call these songs \u0026ldquo;songlines\u0026rdquo; in his book of the same name. A character in the first chapter of that book said that the Aborigines may have songlines for the entire Australia, making all of Australia sacred.\nIn his book Cosmic Sage, George Williams said that many Japanese unitarians in the early twentieth century believed everything was religion. Politics, commerce, and education were all religious. They didn\u0026rsquo;t see a distinction between the religious and the secular. Because of this, Japanese pastors, who were ministers of other Christian denominations but who had unitarian sympathies, ran for public office. Successful business people gave their money to churches, while those who found themselves inside the classroom committed themselves to the whole religious development of children. Shinto, Japan\u0026rsquo;s ancient way of life, may have influenced this inclination to view everything as sacred.\nI was thinking about the songlines and the Japanese unitarians while inside the jeep that would take me to where I ended my walk yesterday. As I exited the vehicle, I told myself that this walk would be about encountering the religious and spiritual in places where we were taught they would never exist. I wonder whether there is anything sacred along the fishing communities of Los Baños: Bambang, Baybayin, Malinta, Mayondon, and Bayog.\nA man seemed so surprised to see his neighbor. His neighbor said he was already living in Pangasinan. The man asked him what he\u0026rsquo;d do with his house. \u0026ldquo;Will you rent it out?\u0026rdquo; he said.\nOn my left is a concrete wall not too high to prevent one from seeing what\u0026rsquo;s inside. On top of the wall are curled chicken wires.\nBambang is home to a large military camp, Camp General Macario Sakay. Behind it, toward the beach, are resorts. The railroad, home to many low-income families, separates the soldiers from the vacationers.\nI saw an Ilocano restaurant along Bambang Road. Aptly called \u0026ldquo;Mangan,\u0026rdquo; it features many recipes I often eat back in Pangasinan. Mangan is the word for \u0026ldquo;eat\u0026rdquo; in at least three Philippine languages: Ilocano, Pangasinan, and Kapampangan. Ilocano recipes are almost the same as the food I grew up eating, so I often wonder whether there is even an authentic Pangasinense cuisine. The restaurant is still closed, but I could see all the bottles of Smirnoff lined up on its bar. Those should have been bottles of basi or bugnay.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve seen many yellow things in the past few days. You would be surprised how popular this color is. In particular, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of yellow houses. They can\u0026rsquo;t be missed from afar, and I can\u0026rsquo;t help but stare at them whenever I pass them.\n\u0026ldquo;This house is too yellow,\u0026rdquo; I tell myself sometimes.\nMy girlfriend and her family had a game, which I think started when they still lived in Bahrain. The rule is simple: anyone who sees a yellow car first wins. Her father has been dead for almost five years. Only her brother is left in Bahrain. She no longer lives with her family, but whenever she sees a yellow car when we walk together, she rushes to call it out.\nAs I turned down Bambang Road, past Dampalit Creek, I noticed an eerie silence. It was unusually long that I thought I was losing my hearing.\nSomewhere past the railroad, there is a wake. She was 72 years old. Her remains are inside a small apartment unit without a gate. The door is open, and some adults and children are awake. Across the street was a blue open tent inside of which were a set of Monobloc table and chairs. There were cigarette butts and empty beer bottles around. Someone was picking up empty bags of chips.\nOn the dried Dampalit Creek, an orange cat lies motionless in the middle of rocks and garbage. Is it dead? Is it just sleeping?\nWhat does it mean to love a place? Do I need to sing songs when I walk? Do I need to repeat them until I know them by heart? Do I need to pray or perhaps hold rituals under the trees, even worshiping them?\nAre these men and women walking the street this early morning with sweeping brooms in hand, giggling, laughing, not also in love with their spaces? Is this not enough?\nI\u0026rsquo;m delighted with my progress in saying good morning to people I meet along the way. Just now, I was able to greet two ladies. One was picking a few malunggay stalks from her garden, while another was walking in the opposite direction. Both returned my greeting. This is a practice I still find challenging to do now, so these little wins mean so much to me.\nI walked straight into Burgos Street. I remember this street being more crowded than it is now. It has been almost two years since I last went here. The tiny house with a new car and a lot of cages for pigeons and fighting cocks is still here. The old abandoned wooden house seems gone. The black Labrador Retriever is still guarding the garage of a fenced compound.\nAt the end of Burgos Street, an older man, covered with white facial hair, stood at the last house\u0026rsquo;s door. I greeted him, smiled, and asked permission to take photos at the dock beside his home.\nOn the dock were several boats pulled to shore. The tide is high, so the large rocks I remembered sitting on in the past were submerged. A teenager wearing a sweater hid behind long grasses. He was fishing and didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be bothered.\nThis here is Los Baños’ old port. There is no platform, only the large, solid posts that once held the platform. I have yet to read anything written about this port, but just by looking at its size, one could immediately see that it served an essential role for the town in the past.\nThe lilies are too dense. They move together when the water moves. From afar, it looks like watching a large furry animal breathe.\nAfter leaving Burgos Street, I walked Villegas Street, which leads to the center of town. Walking closer to the center, one can not help but notice the several Spanish occupation ancestral houses lined up perfectly. Centuries after the plaza complex was instituted to make it easier for Spanish colonizers to subdue the natives, it is still felt even by lone walkers like me.\nThe Christmas season is here. It brings a particular joy that I know is genuinely true for some people. Growing up in a family that never celebrated Christmas, I am still learning a lot about this most famous of all holidays. I’m still learning how best to spend it, practice gift-giving, and perhaps most importantly, how I could personally make sense of a celebration with heavy religious origins in the kind of spirituality I’m cultivating for myself.\nOn the map, Mayondon is another hill. It is the hill I see when I walk at Juan V. Pancho Street inside UPLB, an elevated point where one can see the rest of the town and the lake.\nBefore climbing the hill, though, I revisited another fishing community, one with a large basketball court.\nOn my way to the court, I saw a large tarpaulin outside a house. It congratulated someone who passed the Nutritionist-Dietician licensure exam. I wondered why they had to use two photos for what looked like the same person. Upon closer inspection, these were indeed different people. They’re identical twins. Both studied at UPLB, took the same course, took the licensure exam, and passed it simultaneously. It\u0026rsquo;s something you don\u0026rsquo;t see every day.\nEvery time I visit this court, it’s always full of children. Today, a Saturday morning, about twenty children are playing in the middle of the court. Two boys play one-on-one basketball on one half of the court while around ten children, girls and boys of different ages, sit on the rough concrete floor on the other side. Two of them are bickering back at each other. Two girls stood up and started playing ball.\nSeeing how popular basketball is among the youth, local government units in the Philippines build basketball courts, hoping the ball will sway children away from drugs. This basketball court they made here at Mayondon alongside Laguna Lake, with Mt. Makiling at the backdrop, is one of the best courts I\u0026rsquo;ve seen built for a community composed mainly of low-income families surviving through money earned from fishing or selling fish.\nThis rectangular piece of concrete in space brings children together to believe life can be joyful amid danger and poverty. This basketball court is sacred for this reason alone, and these paragraphs are my songlines for it.\nAt the foot of Mayondon Hill, a group of men and women in formal attire is walking uphill. I knew immediately that these were JWs doing their Saturday rounds. That kid walking in the middle with the sling bag was me 20 years ago. Who would\u0026rsquo;ve thought that on this morning walk, I would share this street with them?\nIn another life, I would\u0026rsquo;ve known these people. I would\u0026rsquo;ve been among them. I would\u0026rsquo;ve been that person at the front taking that photo.\n\u0026ldquo;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.\u0026rdquo;\nA church stands tall at the peak of Mayondon Hill. A few steps after the church, a large house covered by even more giant trees caught my attention. On the top of its facade was a circle, inside of which was an ichthys symbol and a rice stalk with grains.\nThe ichthys is, of course, an ancient symbol for Christianity, while the grains remind one of Jesus\u0026rsquo; walk in the middle of a ripe field of grain, picking some heads of wheat and eating them along with his disciples in defiance of the Sabbath.\nLos Baños is both grain and fish.\nKanluran Street is perhaps the largest fishing community in Los Baños. Located in Barangay Bayog, most locals here are either fishermen or fish vendors. The fishermen live on huts right above the water. Their boats are now parked on mud, but when the tide grows, they float right outside the doors of these humble abodes. The children here talk about who owns this and that boat.\nSome families grow animals, primarily ducks, which eat whatever they can find in the mud and can also float on salt water to hunt for a few errant fishes.\nInterestingly, this is one of the quietest communities I\u0026rsquo;ve ever walked here in Los Baños. I could walk for hours on this stretch and won\u0026rsquo;t hear a word from locals.\nAside from fishermen\u0026rsquo;s houses, the stalls of fish vendors line up on the side of the road. Poorly preserved, some fish would be covered by flies before being sold. That said, fish here should be way fresher and perhaps cheaper than those sold in the market.\nMy walk ended on a long stretch of Santo Domingo Street, a narrow road filled with vehicles. One stopped, called me, and asked for instructions on finding an alternate route to Calamba City. \u0026ldquo;Just go straight. Do not enter any eskinitas. Stay on the large road, then turn on the first left,\u0026rdquo; I said.\nAs I end this walk, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but notice a stark difference between walking among fisher folks and walking inside UPLB, UPOU, and IRRI. Walking inside the institutions, I often saw objects I knew nothing about. There, esoteric machines remind me of my ignorance, powerlessness, and subordination to theory. Here, near the sea, among fishes and those who live by catching and selling them, a more direct interaction with reality, objects, and other human beings happens almost every moment. People live and make a living through their hands. They touch matter as matter touches them.\nIf everything is spiritual, then spirituality is in both the intellect of Makiling and the depth of experience of Laguna de Bay. To learn how to master and integrate both states of being is necessary to survive in a world like Los Baños.\nBambang Road → Lopez Street → Villegas Street → Burgos Street → A.

The jeepney arrived at Bagong Kalsada with rain pouring hard. I got off, opened my umbrella, and ran to the nearest shade: a bakeshop at the mouth of the road that would take me to my destination.\nAs soon as I took shade, the rain weakened. I bought a piece of pan de coco and a piece of Spanish bread before beginning my walk. Despite the bad weather, people were busy buying fish at the nearby wet market. Perhaps we were all fooled by the slight brightening of the sky a while ago.\nLopez Avenue was virtually traffic-less. My jeep immediately reached the avenue\u0026rsquo;s junction with the Manila South Road. Inside are several young people, some with large bags, perhaps en route to Manila. One reached out to the passenger nearest him and asked for help with his fare. He told the driver to drop him at Olivarez Plaza.\nAt the junction, we halted and waited for the streetlights to do their thing. The traffic system at this junction is more functional than most I’ve seen. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many municipalities, even cities in the Philippines, with less functional junctions than this one. In Pangasinan, whenever my father stops the car at the signal of a traffic enforcer, he utters the exact words: \u0026ldquo;It gets longer when there\u0026rsquo;s a traffic enforcer.\u0026rdquo; I believe him. Often, in Pangasinan, drivers figure out the traffic by themselves. Without rules, they do the job faster by intuition or pure respect for other drivers. I wonder whether it\u0026rsquo;s a generational thing, though. Perhaps younger drivers need enforcers.\nAn old traffic enforcer, who seems past the retirement age, sits inside the shed and talks via a microphone. He calls out errant drivers or gives directions for each lane. Whenever I see him at this junction, I often hear him utter, \u0026ldquo;Sige lang. Go lang ng go.\u0026rdquo;\nHe isn\u0026rsquo;t here this morning. Perhaps he\u0026rsquo;ll come later, or has he finally retired?\nThe jeep stopped at the Olivarez Plaza, the drainage system of which is being repaired. People waiting for buses are forced to wait beside a bank.\nOn our way to Bagong Kalsada, two motorcycles blasted to overtake our jeep on the right. Briefly, I feared for the lives of two cyclists slowly making their way up the slope of the highway.\nI ambled as the road was still wet. The rain weakened to a drizzle, and I saw motorcyclists driving without coats.\nOn a resort nearby, construction continues, a sign that business is doing okay, even recovering, despite the intermittent lockdowns.\nI stopped to read the welcome sign. So it is: I am in Masili, a barangay of Calamba in its Real district. This is no longer Los Baños.\nIt began raining hard again, so I opened my umbrella. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t long before I started feeling large drops of rain from the inside. I looked under my umbrella to inspect it and saw that there was indeed a hole.\nStill, with my umbrella opened, I walked to a nearby iron shed ironically shaped like an umbrella.\nThis walk was starting to feel off.\n\u0026ldquo;Bagong Kalsada\u0026rdquo; (New Road) is an interesting name. I wonder how it got its name. If it has the word bago (new), what did this place look like when it was luma (old)?\nBoth sides are filled with either gates to subdivisions or resorts. Some resorts are almost invisible, with a signboard hanging outside but an entrance out of sight. Perhaps they are located inside these heavily guarded subdivisions.\nIt must be said here that Los Baños—the Baths—has always been famous for the hot water that runs under it. When I bathe here around December, I don\u0026rsquo;t need to warm my water. Mt. Makiling warms it for me. A dormant volcano, it is the source of this geothermal water that has given many locals from Pansol to Masili good business since the Spanish occupation. If Masili isn\u0026rsquo;t Los Baños anymore, it is piggybacking on the success of the older and more popular resorts on the highway.\nWhen I arrived at the corner of Bagong Kalsada and Tadlac Street, I was surprised to see a railroad. I thought I would walk on the rails toward the lake or perhaps ride trolleys. I was relieved to see that a cemented road for cars was just beside the rails. Turning right, I walked on this road to the lake.\nWalking on Tadlac Street felt like walking in Rizal, Quezon, on the streets beside the rails, except there are no trolleys.\nAlong the street, the side of the road started to ascend, houses began to descend, and the mountain—great Mt. Makiling was revealed.\nI just passed by a signboard about the lake. Its name is Tadlac. Google Maps calls it Alligator Lake for a reason I am still to find out. On the sign board, Tadlac is mentioned as a barangay of Los Baños, which means that Masili and Tadlac are the boarder barangays of Calamba City and Los Baños. Bagong Kalsada, the street I just walked on, is their border.\nCrossing the railroad and continuing my walk of Bagong Kalsada, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but notice a tight-knit community of locals. I\u0026rsquo;ve walked some communities deep inside Calamba City and I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen something like this. Neighbors gathered outside their houses early this morning. Some sell their products to their neighbors themselves. Everyone talks to everyone. Everyone knows everyone.\nBut do they have any choice? Their houses are beside each other; some even share a single wall. With your neighbors living this near you, you have no option but to be good to them. Unlike other places in the world, proximity seems to be saving this community. I always feel safe whenever I walk here.\nAs I got deeper into Tadlac Street, I noticed signs of the pandemic—writings on the walls on the side of the road reminding people of curfew hours, community gardens perhaps built to address hunger at those times, and the biggest surprise of all, an isolation facility at the heart of the barangay.\nThe rain started pouring hard as I was about to make a left turn toward the lake. I started talking to myself, calling the walk a lousy idea. To make matters worse, there was no shade to run to.\nI saw a closed store with a small portion of its roof protruding in front. I dragged my feet under the water to reach it and stood there as straight as possible under the roof. While waiting for the rain to stop, I felt my socks squishing around my feet. I remember buying these shoes three years ago because they were waterproof. Now, they seemed to have lost all their waterproofing.\nRealizing that the roof I stood under wasn\u0026rsquo;t saving me from all the water, I decided to continue walking and taking in all this rain. It was impossible to check my phone to know where I was, so I followed the trail.\nAfter a few minutes of walking an elevated part of the road, water rushing through my feet, the other lake, the bigger one, Laguna Lake, emerged from my right. The sky was all gray, but the lake was there.\nAfter walking between houses on a footpath that could only fit one person and climbing the stairs that came after, I finally saw Laguna Lake. On this overcast morning, the waters gave off their deep blue color, and a mist barely concealed the mountains over the horizon.\nAn older man was already there. He sat on the protective wall of this viewing deck with his knees on his chest. I moved carefully not to destroy his peace.\nAfter I stood a reasonable distance from him for a while, he stood up, perhaps satisfied with his morning dose of lake beauty, and went down the stairs I came from.\nFive children emerged from the stairs that led down to the houses below on the beach. I looked down and saw two other children fixing a boat. The older one was pulling what looked like a rope, and the small one watched while sitting on another boat.\nTwo of the five children who emerged from the stairs asked me to photograph them. I did so joyfully. They thanked me after. The boy asked me what I was doing. I said I\u0026rsquo;m just enjoying how beautiful their place is. He said, \u0026ldquo;Yes, indeed.\u0026rdquo;\nI knew I was near, so I continued walking despite the rain not showing any sign of letting up. A man was sitting in a shed having his coffee. He wore an old blue cap and a green jacket. Behind him, I saw it: Tadlac Lake.\nThe path to the lake was a long set of stairs, which, right now, was overrun by brown water flowing from the road to the dock and then the lake. I began descending toward the lake, walking carefully over running water to avoid slipping.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s weird, but the rain made the lake look perfect. It brought with it a mist that concealed Mt. Makiling at the horizon. There was no other human here, only some herons perched on a few trees at the north end of the lake, some small wild ducks swimming at the edges of the water, and the occasional tiny blue kingfishers diving and then hiding under leaves.\nI stood under the shade of a large and tall tree with my broken umbrella open. I reached inside my bag for the bread I bought at the bakeshop and started eating.\nWhile I was enjoying the still-warm bread, it stopped raining. My goodness, it finally stopped. I realized this walk wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad after all. A heavy rain meant no one else would be here.\nI remembered the artificial lake I frequented back home at Pangasinan, a dam that traps rainwater for the crops below it. Seeing Tadlac Lake was the first time I\u0026rsquo;ve been close to a body of water since the lockdowns started.\nI stayed for at least an hour: I took photos, watched the birds through my binoculars, took some videos, and left.\nA couple was already on the lake when I arrived. Two young people sitting beside each other at the end of the dock, giggling, exchanging inaudible murmurs. I walked toward the inverted boats at the other end of the pier and started taking photographs of the lake and Mt. Makiling over it.\nHere is the best view of Mt. Makiling over a body of water. From where I was standing, I could see the details of lumps of trees on Mt. Makiling’s side. One could never see this much detail when the mountain is over Laguna Lake.\nThere were no fishermen today, no boats tied near the dock. It is no-fishing season on the lake from April to December says a sign. Everyone seen fishing on the lake will be apprehended. I didn’t see this sign on my first walk here in 2021, which was December, too. Perhaps the lake\u0026rsquo;s fish population is declining and must be protected. If this no-fishing season continues to be implemented, local fishermen will have to look for alternative jobs for more than half of the year. Obviously, the larger Laguna Lake is on the other side of this hill. But how easy is it really to find work as a fisherman?\nWalking back to Bagong Kalsada through Tadlac Street, I passed by a railroad community. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but notice that this is a community that communicates. It communicates through words written all around them. Signboards abound.\nA puppy approached me, encircling my feet, so I tried to distance myself. Its master, a middle-aged man fixing his laundry outside, noticed and said something briefly about his dog. I welcomed his words and responded with a smile.\nTurning from Tadlac Street to Bagong Kalsada, I noticed two older women talking while standing across a table. The younger woman was buying kakanin (rice cakes) from the older woman. I approached them and waited for their transaction to finish.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve eaten a lot of kakanin in my life, but I’ve never seen it done,\u0026rdquo; I told the older woman when the younger woman left. \u0026ldquo;Come, come here,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Have a taste of our latik (toasted coconut milk curd) and see how crisp it is!\u0026rdquo;\nI pinched a small amount. \u0026ldquo;Go on. Pinch a bigger one!\u0026rdquo; she said.\nBehind her was a large covered wok under lit firewood. Its smoke released no smell. I wondered what was in it.\nA younger woman saw us talking and approached us. After introducing myself, she started telling the story of their family. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m Lorena, and this is my mom. People call her Aling Maring,\u0026rdquo; she answered when I asked for their names.\n\u0026ldquo;This is what we\u0026rsquo;ve been doing all our lives. I learned to cook kakanin from my grandparents. My lolo lived until 102 but only stopped making kakanin four years before he died,\u0026rdquo; Lorena continued.\nAling Maring explained how their kakanin is different from the others. \u0026ldquo;As you can see, we don\u0026rsquo;t cook them in machines. We don\u0026rsquo;t mass produce. And that\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;ve always been poor. Kakanin cooked by machine is too hot. Ours is colder and thus has a different texture than most you can buy in the market.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My kakanin has reached other countries. I may be poor, but the rich respect me. You say you are from town? One of the candidates for vice mayor. Oh, he lost. He buys only from us. Christmas is coming. We get a lot of orders this season.\u0026rdquo;\nI bought one order of each of the kakanin available on the table: an order of puto, biko, and tikoy. They gave me their phone number so I could contact them for future orders.\nBack home, after lunch, I took a bite of Aling Maring’s tikoy. It is smaller than most tikoy, more dense_,_ and stickier. But it is tastier. Every particle seems to burst with flavor. And the latik, oh the latik. It definitely is crispier.\nI remember IRRI. I remember rice. Kakanin is rice and shall be the point of departure through which I could understand this rice grain better.\nNever shall I walk this stretch of the Manila South Road again. Although some areas have sidewalks, sharp curves do not. It was a dangerous walk on these curves, and I am grateful to have made it past them in one piece.\nBut walking on this suicidal stretch of the Manila South Road reveals a part of Los Baños often unnoticed. Hotels, subdivisions, resorts, and resorts within subdivisions abound. One can\u0026rsquo;t help but notice the largeness of the Makiling Onsen Hotel. Reading those words Makilng (a heavily Filipino word) and Onsen (a heavily Japanese word) feels interesting. Meanwhile, some establishments are left abandoned, perhaps more ruins from the pandemic.\nAfter walking past stretches of \u0026ldquo;the baths,\u0026rdquo; I reached Lalakay, my final destination for this walk. As an enormous truck approached, I crossed the pedestrian lane, running for my life. I heard its brakes screech.\nI walked past the school. I was looking for a signboard pointing to Dampalit Falls but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it. I saw an eskinita that seems familiar. This might be it. To be sure, I looked for a local to ask. There was an early Christmas Party at the school. Or was it part of the barangay festivities? It was Lalakay\u0026rsquo;s barangay fiesta. Vertical flags of various colors adorn its streets. A lady was watching the event inside her sari-sari store, so I peeked and asked her, \u0026ldquo;Is this the way to Dampalit?\u0026rdquo; She said yes, and I thanked her.\nThis walk to Dampalit was surprisingly faster than the first walk I did here early this year. Before a steep hike, one would pass by bungalows through a small eskenita, just large enough to fit a tricycle. But the road is too steep; only motorcycles and bicycles can access it. Locals earn a small amount for parking fees. But since one can only bring bicycles and motorcycles, I don\u0026rsquo;t think they get enough money from parking fees. One house has a signboard with rates. Ten pesos for bicycles. Twenty pesos for motorcycles. I was surprised to see thirty pesos for cars. A car won\u0026rsquo;t fit this eskinita!\nAs I approached the entrance to the falls, a group of children came to me and asked, \u0026ldquo;Are you going to the falls?\u0026rdquo; I said yes. \u0026ldquo;Do you know how to get there?\u0026rdquo; I said yes, and they left me alone.\nThe water is cold here. Really cold. All silence is broken. But here is a sound so alluring I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can live without it again. The strength of the falls depends on the season. There was not much rain the past three days but there was lots of it last week. The strength of the water falling is not as strong as I remember it. I like it better this way—a steady, soothing rhythm.\nWe are all pilgrims. A pilgrim approaches something she holds dear and shows deep care or perhaps even just a brief effusion of awe toward it. But what if the germ from which awe and deep care come is even way simpler than both? What if this desire to break the monotony of one\u0026rsquo;s days, to experience something different for the first time, even if it is as simple as posing in front of a camera, is where all our religiosity comes from?\nI have a pretty good feeling it is.\nBagong Kalsada Street → Tadlac Street → Manila South Road → Dampalit Falls Path\n17,429 steps 8.88 km\n","date":"8 December 2023","permalink":"/rxg1/005/","section":"Roots ྾ Gravel (R྾G)","summary":"","title":"RxG Day 05 The Baths"},{"content":"Day 07, 2023\nNo walking in the morning. No waking up early, too. I set my alarm clock at 8:00 but turned it off and waited until after 15 more minutes before getting up. Around 8:45, I locked myself inside my office to sit the entire morning. These feet are tired. They must rest.\nThe only walking I did from 8:00 to 12:00 was the back and forth from my room to the dirty kitchen to do my laundry. The three long walks that commenced broke my daily routine, and I, mind you, am a human of habits. Today is way past my usual laundry day, so this most domestic of all domestic tasks must be done now.\nNot much writing happened today too; only a couple of journal pages reflecting on an early experience that made a scar on my writing self. I’m finding my way slowly through Pat Schneider’s book Writing Alone and Writing Together, and this is her second exercise.\nAfter this, more laundry, then lunch, then doing the dishes. Ah, I couldn’t remember when these chores last felt this good. Somehow, in between long walks, these chores become healing. Somehow, in between long walks, I find myself in love with being home.\nI’m keeping this missive short. I still have a couple of hours before hitting the bed, and I would very much want to enjoy this day off while it lasts.\nTomorrow, we walk away from Mt. Makiling to visit two bodies of water. I suspect tomorrow’s walks will be shorter than usual. Nonetheless, I still need my pair of well-rested legs for two more days ahead after tomorrow.\nOnce again, thank you for reading. I appreciate everyone responding kindly to these emails and sharing the walk on Instagram. Knowing that, somehow, these walks remind you of how beautiful your own walks are brings me so much joy. Somehow, these walks are accomplishing what I intended them to do.\nMore soon,\nVince\n","date":"7 December 2023","permalink":"/rxg1/004/","section":"Roots ྾ Gravel (R྾G)","summary":"","title":"(RxG) Day 04 Being Home"},{"content":"December 06, 2023\nI underestimated the endurance needed for these walks. Since yesterday, I started feeling a strain on my left foot, which has a history of strains like this one. It\u0026rsquo;s also the first time I woke up at 6:00 in the morning for three straight days in a long time. On top of this, the time required to prepare these email missives is surprisingly huge.\nWhen I reach home around 11:30 in the morning, I immediately upload the photos from my camera to my Macbook, which takes a lot of time. I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing it via wifi, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure whether I should be using a wire instead (and what wire?). It\u0026rsquo;s taking years for the photos to upload. But this forces me to write the missives first, which I tend to finish at least before dinner.\nAfter dinner, it\u0026rsquo;s all photo-related work: culling, editing, and collating images with text. I usually finish around 12 midnight, which gives me just six hours of sleep in the past two nights. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll take a day off from these walks tomorrow and resume on Friday. This means I must cut the number of walking routes for this week-long project. It\u0026rsquo;s okay. We\u0026rsquo;ll have more walks in the future.\nThis morning, I walked on the side of the Manila South Road, the road that connects Los Baños to the rest of Luzon. The road is connected to a network of other roads and highways that would bring you as far as Infanta, Quezon, to the northeast and Matnog, Sorsogon, to the South. It connects with roads that surround Laguna de Bay and those that lead to Batangas.\nI walked this path a few times. Perhaps this is the fifth walk. I walked here twice during the pandemic, a third time when I walked to San Pablo City, and a fourth when I searched for Maahas Road—a search that led me to the Nasa Labas ang Ili (NLAI) route where I guided two groups on contemplative walks last summer.\nThis is the first time I have walked here this early. Amid all these noises, I feel an unexplainable calm. Perhaps it is the coolness of this December breeze, a breeze that isn\u0026rsquo;t typical for Los Baños but reminds me of my December in Pangasinan and Baguio. During my first Christmas season here, I often complained that the Los Baños December was too wet. It rains too much. Up north, I\u0026rsquo;m used to having long, cold, dry days in December, which often extends until February. The weather is a reminder that I have uprooted myself from my past—that I live far, far away from the old home.\nIt took me a while to hold my camera. It dangles down my neck, hitting my heart as I walk, but I feel no need to point it at something or someone. I miss this breeze. This is all that matters to me right now.\nWhat called my hands to touch my camera are these colorful houses along Manila South Road, which I am only noticing right now. I’m amazed at how near they are to the road. This road is as busy as highways could ever get, and yet these people chose to live with all this noise. Being the ultra-sensitive person that I am, I\u0026rsquo;m easily bothered by noisy neighbors, construction, and the infrequent karaoke singing. One thing I love about Mt. Data Streets is it\u0026rsquo;s one of the quietest places here in Lost Baños. This quiet is something I lost in my old home in Pangasinan but which I now have. Silence sustains me.\nSo, I’m compelled to ask: How does one live in the middle of all this noise? I look at the locals, some really old, sitting outside their houses this morning full of contentment, and I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of how resilient and adaptable all of us can be. We can all learn to find peace in the middle of noise and perhaps even find contentment in it.\nI remember that absolute silence is impossible, and there is always sound around us. I remember most of my ancestors lived beside rivers that constantly filled the air with sound.\nI trail behind a man who talks to people he passes by. He briefly stopped by the small bridge that crosses a stream of the Molawin River to exchange pleasantries with someone living in a three-story building beside the river. He continues walking only to stop again to talk with another man. I would very much want to be like this person.\nMy plan was to walk past the entrance to Maahas Road and get inside the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to walk around for a bit before returning to walk Maahas Road. However, upon entering the gate to UPOU, I realized how easy it is to access IPB Road from IRRI, so I decided to skip Maahas Road altogether. I have walked that road in the past anyway and have actually written about it, too. UPOU and IRRI, on the other hand, I am yet to walk around.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s much to be said about one\u0026rsquo;s first walk in an unfamiliar place. The potential to discover something new regardless of the pleasantness of the sites by itself is fulfilling. I think a big portion of this fulfillment comes from confronting what is unknown, what has been a dark part of one\u0026rsquo;s world for so long until now—the wilderness.\nAside from visiting the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at UPOU and the famous IRRI canteen, most of this place is a wilderness for me. Security measures here were really strict during the pandemic, so I never dared to enter either, even if they were relatively near Pili Drive, where I often walk. In fact, I just learned that Pili Drive extends to the IRRI-UPOU complex.\nToday, I sought to know whether the complex is already open to the public and if it has returned to pre-pandemic situations when motorists and pedestrians come and go liberally. I warmed up by taking photos of the parking space just outside the UPOU gate. Then, I walked alongside two ladies who seemed to be students entering the guarded gate. I was let in. No questions were asked.\nWhen I walk around a large place for the first time, I use a map. But the map only tells possible pathways. It won\u0026rsquo;t tell you whether those pathways lead you to places you could access or are allowed to access. I had many experiences when I followed the map and was led to a path that was no longer used. For fear that this would happen here, I followed the path people were taking, the right sidewalk, which eventually led to IRRI and its portion of Pili Drive.\nThere is a constant flux of vehicles in and out of IRRI. It must have been open now for motorists. I last got in here in 2020 before the lockdown. Now is my first time walking around it by myself.\nIRRI is an international research body located in 17 countries, mostly in Asia, but which chose the Philippines to be its headquarters, built here in Los Baños, Laguna. IRRI was founded in 1960, but I am yet to know at what year exactly this headquarters in Los Baños was built.\nI walked on the sidewalk dangerously near Pili Drive, where vehicles come and go, and across are what seemed to be these large greenhouses filled with specimens. Talk about wilderness, I am confronted with my ignorance of what is happening inside this place.\nA co-fellow at the Ateneo National Writers Workshop, whose MA thesis was about the agricultural sector of the Philippines, presented a paper that offered a critique of agricultural modernization in the Philippines. He mentioned that IRRI has become famous for inventing many rice varieties, such as the IR-8, which grew in popularity under the name \u0026ldquo;miracle rice\u0026rdquo; in the 1990s.\nWhile it promises to feed more people and achieve rice sufficiency, what rice varieties, such as miracle rice, do to once-rural areas like Los Baños is significantly reconstruct them by replacing century-old rice varieties and the traditions that come with them. The new rice varieties that replace them increase food production, a goal tied with nation-building but which is sometimes dislocated with the goals and traditions of local farmers.\nSitting now to rest at this shed in IRRI, I see several employees working in the fields. Their bodies are fully covered against the sun. They hold dirt and carry sacks of hay. I am forced to think about food, and especially rice, the most trivial of all food in the Philippines, a food that has defined Asians in general and a food that has sustained my ancestors for millennia.\nRice is what enabled anthropologists to identify where my race came from. Through rice stuck in ceramics, they were able to correct early mistaken claims that the first men to people the Philippines came through land bridges. No, they didn\u0026rsquo;t. They came through boats: a sea-faring people. And they took with them this white food from heaven. Through rice, anthropologists were able to describe the Austronesian (or Nusantao), the ancestors of Filipinos, Australian aborigines, Pacific islanders, and even the Malagasy of Madagascar.\nFood is worth thinking about. Rice, among all food, is worth thinking about. Rice and all food are matter that sustains me and replaces the cells that my body sheds. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t exist without food. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think or speak without food. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t write these words now without food. And yet, I seldom think about it. I seldom think about the amount of violence that happens just for a spoonful of rice to reach my mouth.\nFood makes Los Baños an interesting place. While large, powerful bodies like UPLB and IRRI are here, constantly dictating the discourse and policies surrounding food, a small, disorganized grassroots movement made of organic food sellers, organic farming advocates, and healthy food alternative sellers exist. Unfortunately, this movement (if we can even call it one) has been struggling recently.\nOne business, which used to be my go-to source of organic vegetables, has been forced to reimagine itself into a Japanese restaurant, perhaps to save itself from dying. Another business is closing its shops to transition to supplying. Thinking about these advocates and sitting here inside IRRI makes me feel powerless. I stood up, took a few more photos, and walked the rest of Pili Drive, which brought me out of IRRI.\nA few months ago, I decided to walk Maahas Road for the first time (Maahas means \u0026ldquo;full of snakes\u0026rdquo;). I started at the mouth of the road from the Manila South Road, which led me to IPB Road, the road parallel to the train tracks of Los Baños. At IPB Road, I saw a footpath on the side of one of the fields owned by UPLB along Pili Drive. I followed the path and discovered a beautiful trail reminiscent of those I took beside rice fields back in Pangasinan. When given the privilege to guide a group of lovely humans for a late afternoon walk in April, I brought them here. I am walking it again, saying hello once more.\nAs I walk this dirt road and remember the past walks, a group of myna\u0026rsquo;s perched on the power lines above me. They stayed there for just a second when one of them released a loud call, which made all of them fly.\nIt is grass-cutting season inside the campus. Yesterday, cutters were clearing a part of Forestry. Today, a group of men gathered outside the irrigation machine beside a deep rice paddy field on this trail. The men wore long sleeves, and grass cutters lay on the path. I smell the smell of newly cut grass. One of them was inside the small chamber of the machine as smoke was coming out. He seemed to be cooking. It is eleven, and these men are hungry.\nI walked past them, and in front of me, another man on his motorcycle approached me. I moved to make room for him. Behind him, two dogs ran to follow him.\nThe grass is indeed tall. The spot where the first batch of walkers I guided here last summer sat and lay down to rest at the second leg of our walk is now less friendly to those needing rest. I continued walking. The sun above me is too hot, and the light is less generous for photographs.\nAfter reaching the end of the dirt path, I turned left to Pili Drive once more. An event is ongoing, blocking the entire half of the road reserved for walkers, joggers, and bikers. I crossed the roads to walk to the other side. The moment I stepped on the elevated footpath, a person ran toward me putting his arm around my shoulders—a friend, someone who joined one of those walks I guided last April. We walked and chatted a bit before he left me for work. Pili Drive is home to several engineering departments. Here, alongside rice fields, students study how to structure society better.\nI continued walking toward IPB Road, looking for decent shots of the mountains of San Pablo. Sunlight is too strong now, and I\u0026rsquo;m starting to doubt whether I should still take photos.\nAll these walking led me to the final segment of the walk: the San Luis Road that cuts through Barangay Putho Tuntungin, the jump-off point to Hill Road, home to some of the fanciest houses in Los Baños.\nThese walks are like religious activities. One of the root words of \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;religare,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;to bind fast.\u0026rdquo; To bind fast could mean to put yourself under an obligation or a bond with another, whether a human or deity. This is where the idea of religion being something that constricts us comes from.\nBut binding oneself to something could lead to more freedom. Absolute freedom can never exist, and too much of it can be crippling. I find that I need a healthy dose of binding to feel structured enough that I can start feeling free. For example, I need to bind myself to work that earns me a living so that I can be free to write and do walks like these on occasion. Binding oneself to a vocation, a belief, or a person could bring a sense of security that would allow one to be free. Of course, binding always involves a measure of sacrifice and patience.\nThese walks are binding as I am required to follow certain rules to perform them well, and they can feel strenuous sometimes. But they bring a kind of freedom that is so difficult to find in a world where I am almost always bound.\nSpeaking of structure, I notice that a significant portion of my walk today has been spent thinking about the structure of this missive. This makes me wonder whether treating some portion of our lives like a project could give us a similar sense of structure.\nTurning our lives into a project doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean making our lives presentable to others but presentable to us. Can we weave a story that we can tell ourselves later when we badly need direction and structure?\nHere\u0026rsquo;s my main point: the structure doesn\u0026rsquo;t come by sitting down and thinking about it. It often comes when you are doing something else, something between consciousness and unconsciousness. Something like walking. I walk, and then later, I forget that I\u0026rsquo;m walking. My feet do the walking for me. This frees my mind and opens it up for the structures, the stories that I need to make sense of my often chaotic self.\nAs I end this walk, I utter a few words of thanks to the crows that seem to follow me from IRRI to Tuntungin Putho. I give thanks to the Molawin River, which has been utterly patient to all of us.\nManila South Road → University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) → International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) → Maahas Road → Molawin Creek Dirt Road → Pili Drive → IPB Road → San Luis Road (Tuntungin Putho) → Hill Road → Valentino G.

It was only around 7:00 when I started to feel the streets changing and with them, my mood. Today, the morning gushed to me both from and toward Raymundo Gate. I march alongside students entering the campus, choosing our own spots as vehicles make their way out of the gate. The traffic enforcer and the pedestrian lane have no use in these instances. We all follow each other\u0026rsquo;s movements, an unspoken agreement, bringing us to where we need to be.\nAfter Raymundo Gate, I walked the slope of Jose R. Velasco Avenue.\nWelcome to UPLB, a campus of interesting histories, some unwritten, including the story behind these street names.\nIf one becomes a regular walker of the campus, one would notice that some streets would have concrete signs, on the side, way below. Most of these names are one word: usually, the name of a tree. The first sign I saw was one under a large tree at the extension of Jose D. Drilon Jr. Street. It is \u0026ldquo;Caimito\u0026rdquo; (star apple). The second I saw was in front of the Pulp and Paper Research and Training Center at the College of Forestry along Domingo M. Lantican Avenue. This one said, \u0026ldquo;Narra.\u0026rdquo; Interestingly, nearby is the Narra Guest House, perhaps the biggest house along the avenue, often empty.\nI think I came to the conclusion slowly by myself that these were the old names of the streets. Jose D. Drilon Jr. Street was once Caimito. Domingo M. Lantican Avenue was once Narra. Writing this now, I discovered that someone wrote about this change in a blog post dated October 24, 2012. According to the writer, the change of streets started around 2008 with the new names after esteemed alumni and professors of the school.\nAll this makes me think about how we name the structure of dirt, rocks, soil, grass, and cement that we call roads, streets, and avenues. As a walker, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any say as to how to name these paths my feet kiss daily. Those with the power to name and rename them do so with a specific agenda I won\u0026rsquo;t always be able to connect. These new names are like the Linnean taxonomy. They uproot me from my experience of the object being named. I wonder whether I should rename these streets with my own fictionalized names. Fiction sometimes is closer to truth.\nCars, people jogging, students brisk walking, laborers having breakfast while in their boots, and work clothes—such is the quality of the morning rush inside UPLB.\nAt Makiling\u0026rsquo;s foot, man cannot keep up with nature. Nature cannot keep up with man. Each point in the geography, in the landscape, and even one\u0026rsquo;s immediate space is a manifestation of this tension. Sometimes, they even out (as in Freedom Park). Sometimes nature consumes all (as in abandoned houses near Forestry). Sometimes, man is obviously winning (as in the new library being built at Jose B. Juliano Avenue).\nI slept too late last night. Too much blue light entered my eyes while editing photos and preparing the first missive of this series. I could\u0026rsquo;ve finished the thing faster had not my vet come for routine vaccinations. She recently came home from Japan, so I made her talk. She said that the current Philippine dairy sector has a lot of similarities with Japan. Both countries don\u0026rsquo;t have an indigenous milk-producing cow breed and have imported their cows for dairy purposes. Also, both are experimenting with strengthening their beef production capabilities through genetics. In terms of Japan, they have started crossbreeding their indigenous cows with an imported variety creating Wagyu beef. My vet said we don\u0026rsquo;t need crossbreeding as our indigenous carabao\u0026rsquo;s meat can compete. The carabao, she said, could be a draft animal, a dairy animal, and a meat animal. She went on to praise her decision to specialize in large animals. She said working on large animals is less complicated because people are not emotionally invested in them. They are there for draft, dairy, and meat. Meanwhile, small animals are there mainly for their love.\nI am reminded of this conversation while walking inside UPLB this morning. The question of how we relate with animals is the question of how we relate with others and places. Everything boils down to which people and places we are most emotionally invested in and not. Contemplating this, surprisingly, could explain all sorts of prejudice.\nAs I turned toward Jasmin, two tiny girls sat on the top of a huge hill of sand. The road is currently under repair. I stopped, turned to them like I was James Bond, and jokingly aimed the camera at them. They seemed to like this very much. I went back to walking, but they called me again. I looked back, and they giggled.\nSometimes, I want to leave LB. But often, I realize what the alternative is. And that makes me feel more grateful for the status quo.\nA yellow and black butterfly appears.\nSome of the best houses on the campus are located on this long road called Doña Aurora. It is a path parallel to the larger Jamboree Road and the smaller Jose D. Drilon Jr. Street. I enjoy walking in this neighborhood for its silence. Without clouds, one would also see Mt. Makiling\u0026rsquo;s peak.\nAt the end of Doña Aurora, you could turn right to a small tree-filled street called Heliconia. Heliconia will bring you to SEARCA\u0026rsquo;s Executive Houses. I imagine these buildings are for the most esteemed guests of the university. They\u0026rsquo;re often empty, with only a single guard to watch them.\nI often walk here in slippers. Walkers and joggers seem to avoid this road.\nIn front of an executive house, a new building is being built. This morning, the workers lined up for a picture-taking. I ran quickly behind them to avoid the camera. As I continued walking, a van full of laborers (some already hanging outside the vehicle) passed by. They seemed to be going to where the picture-taking was happening.\nMany buildings are being built in the university. Man and gravel is currently winning.\nThese walks are a dance between walking, writing, and photography. I never force the writing. I focus on looking, and that is photography. As long as you take care of images, words will follow. You take care of images by walking right.\nYesterday, I took around 160 photographs in five hours of walking. That\u0026rsquo;s like one photo every two minutes. I don\u0026rsquo;t take photos with that rhythm, though. I notice I take more photos when I\u0026rsquo;m walking slowly and not thinking, often in the earliest hours of these walks. By 10, I start to lose steam, and the photo capturing becomes less frequent.\nNot all photos are worth keeping, and not all worth keeping are worth sharing. Among 160 photographs, I only shared about 20 photos yesterday.\nA shitzu\u0026rsquo;s head outside the window of the front passenger\u0026rsquo;s seat just passed by me. That would\u0026rsquo;ve been a nice photo. But the best photos are often the photos we never take.\nAs I leave Doña Aurora, I spot a few herons walking on the short grasses under the sun. A few yards from them, someone is cutting the grass.\nAt the back of our house in San Jacinto, Pangasinan, herons follow the motorized plow or tractor whenever it begins to till the soil at the beginning of the planting season. They look for mollusks, insects, and other little things they can eat. I once called this a symbiosis between heron and machine.\nI wonder whether they are drawn toward the sound of the motorized cutter.\nI smell someone cooking daing, which brings me right back to that dining table in Pangasinan.\nWalking down Melanio A. Gapud, I remember that when I set the route for today\u0026rsquo;s walk, I did it mostly by intuition. I knew I needed to begin in Velasco before hiking up to Forestry and going down to the streets around Freedom Park to sort of embrace the campus. I\u0026rsquo;ve walked these streets too many times I feel like there are no more words and images to be found in them. I have written their names on my computer many times, I can recite them by heart. That is how much I have walked these paths. I am not sure whether this is love, though, or whether it is obsession.\nA family passed by.\nI sometimes find myself debating whether to have children or not. Things are getting worse, it seems evil to bring people into this mess. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be overly attached to them and to their children. And I am afraid I might pass on something bad. I now know that love is impossible without these fears. LB is a good place to have a family. It lessens the bad inherent in the world.\nWalking up this steep, mossy sidewalk toward the College of Forestry, I see that talinum has overgrown once more. Talinum was part of the stew that Japanese soldiers fed the over 2,000 prisoners inside the infamous Los Baños internment camp during World War II. The camp encompassed half of the present-day Freedom Park and most of the College of Veterinary Medicine and the dorms around it.\nThe Japanese would feed the prisoners, mostly Westerners, at 7 in the morning. Their breakfast was usually just rice and coffee. Their next meal would be dinner at 5 pm, which was usually rice and stew full of talinum leaves that must have grown abundantly inside the campus and tiny pieces of meat hidden under the talinum. The Westerners called talinum \u0026ldquo;New England spinach\u0026rdquo; and described it as \u0026ldquo;slimy and metallic.\u0026rdquo; As the Japanese were losing the war, the internees missed their talinum as they were only fed rice.\nMany internees, including children, died of hunger inside the camp. Those who were fortunate to survive the hunger were rescued in the famous Raid of Los Baños on the morning of February 23, 1945.\nI have finally arrived at Forestry. Passing by Arbor Square, I see a few lone students sitting under the sheds. A group of grown men, perhaps professors or admin workers, gather under a tree, sharing stories and laughter.\nSomeone told me recently that today\u0026rsquo;s kids wear clothes different from what we wore ten years ago. I beg to differ: jeans are still the go-to pants, shirts abound, and sneakers are still the national footwear. Or is this true among UP students alone?\nWhy are power lines positioned dangerously low here?\nThose of us who live on Makiling\u0026rsquo;s foot are so close to nature that we\u0026rsquo;ve been so unaware of it. UPLB residential areas here are like solar punk communities gone wrong. Houses yield to the shape of surrounding trees that one would often see roots by gravel. Wild plants from fallen seeds grow on roofs liberally. And yet there seems to be something missing despite all of these: a feeling that all of what surrounds Makiling\u0026rsquo;s foot isn\u0026rsquo;t sustainable.\nThe entire thing is still a keg in a huge industrial-capitalist complex.\nIn the forest, there is no chatter. It’s like an ongoing sesshin, broken only by natural sounds. If this is the wilderness of the spirit, I would very much like to stay here. Forever.\nI feel the tension on my feet and the tiredness in my limbs. But I keep on.\nAt the end of Forestry is the entrance to the Mt. Makiling Trail (MMT). Beside the trail are two branches that both lead to a dead end. The first dead end is wherever the Makiling Botanical Garden ends. The second dead end, I assume, is this: Banuyo. The last of the streets in Forestry I\u0026rsquo;m walking today.\nBefore you reach the cluster of homes at the end of Banuyo, you will pass by a short bridge. At the mouth of the bridge are two interesting objects: a broken concrete staircase covered with vines that lead directly to the river below and a broken van at the side of the road left to be consumed by the forest. Over the van, flowers blossom.\nIt is just my second time to visit this scene. I was so enthralled by the van the first time that I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice the staircase. I surrounded the van like a police enforcer looking at a crime scene.\nToday, I noticed both the stairs and the van, and I can\u0026rsquo;t help but ask whatever turn of events led to where all of these objects are today. I remember Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s notion of the \u0026ldquo;unmoved mover\u0026rdquo; that he presented in Book XI of his Metaphysics.\nIn plain terms, Aristotle argued that everything that changes is in motion. This staircase and the van move even when not in motion because they decay. Now, everything that moves was moved by something else. The vines corrupt the staircase. The forest eats the van. In turn, primordial forces make the vines and the forest grow. And so on and so forth.\nNow, here\u0026rsquo;s where Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s explanation begins to climax. According to him, we cannot trace the source of movement from infinity. We can\u0026rsquo;t have an infinite cause. What we can have is—a first cause. This first cause, this ultimate cause, could not be made of physical matter (because if it is, it could have been moved by something else). Its nature is so mysterious religious people all around the world latched into the notion and called this unmoved mover God.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t made peace with the idea of an unmoved mover. For me, its simplicity is beautiful. This is the only reason why I entertain the possibility of the existence of what people would call a God. But to say that this unmoved mover talks and thinks like me is too far a leap to my taste.\nIn the past, I would pray to Jehovah before I sleep in the evening and before I wake up in the morning. The evening prayers are unusually long. It got to the point where I was talking to him more frequently and deeply than I talked with my real father.\nThe prayers would mostly be about gratitude and asking for forgiveness. In retrospect, all those prayers made my ego too small I was willing to sacrifice everything for an invisible Big Father in heaven. I never asked for anything that would improve my lot materially. I felt like it was wrong to ask for favors.\nI can no longer remember when I last talked to him. All I know is that conversation was full of anger, and things didn\u0026rsquo;t go well.\nFrom 2012 until today, I have never felt the need to talk to someone invisible. I could function well and live my life without serving an omnipotent power. I am no longer afraid of displeasing anyone, especially someone I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see. And I seldom ask for forgiveness, only to those I love that I did hurt (and usually to myself).\nI honestly think one can do away with life without a God. I don\u0026rsquo;t need one to be kind and good and loving. I can be kind and good and loving by myself, by my own choice. I could nurture these habits for myself. I could help others nurture it for themselves. We could all be good without fearing punishment. A purely natural, ethical way of life is possible without a God.\nThe only reason why I call myself an agnostic instead of an atheist is because I intentionally want to make known that I no longer care that much about this issue. The Buddha had some metaphysical ideas but he avoided explaining his metaphysics too much to his disciples that they forget what matters most: compassion.\nThe idea that a god (or gods) exists is perfectly logical, and it is a common belief even among ancient people. A belief in an omnipotent persona solves several metaphysical and epistemological issues. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve everything, and it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary to be good toward others.\nI respect everyone who believes in an omnipotent persona. But I find that it is also my duty to remind people that I can still love them deeply despite our differences. There would be nothing more that would make me happy if they could learn to love me back.\nI am so deep in my thoughts, so deep I fly like this hawk hovering over the green-blanketed sentinels of Makiling\u0026rsquo;s Foot.\nI ended today\u0026rsquo;s walk by walking down Juan V. Pancho Street and turning left to Getulio B. Viado Street to join students walking toward their dorms. It\u0026rsquo;s past 11:00, and everyone is hungry. I stopped briefly to take a photo of another building overcome by nature before turning toward Copeland Gymnasium.\nHere, at Joseph C. Madamba, sunrise shines the best, or so I heard. I walked past an empty lot filled with short trees and bushes that used to be a barn for cattle before turning left to the College of Veterinary Medicine. There, I saw the Carillon Tower emerge out of the trees of Freedom Park.\nJose R. Velasco Avenue → Kanluran Road → Jasmin → Doña Aurora → Heliconia Street → Melanio A. Gapud → Jose D.

I remember her saying that according to the book, animals animals in nature know best how to hide survive longer than most others. After hearing this, I sometimes wondered whether I was hiding too much.\nI live in the farthest unit of a four-unit apartment compound. The family at the first unit, the one nearest the gate, has been here the longest. When I first came here, they were my first friends. The father was keen on introducing himself to me when I first entered the gate. His wife warmed up with me later and gave me a bowl of kimchi she made herself. The couple had two children, both boys, one currently based in Canada, while the other lives with them. I don\u0026rsquo;t see and talk that often with their son who lives with them, even if he seems to be the same age as me. But I often hear his name called by delivery men.\nEarly on, I was surprised to learn that this family was Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses. I heard them singing familiar songs while passing by their unit one time in 2021 when most religious gatherings were done online. In my first year here, the father approached me and invited me to the memorial of Christ\u0026rsquo;s death, the only religious event JWs celebrate. I took the invitation but never attended. He never sent me another the following year; until now, this family doesn\u0026rsquo;t know that I used to be one of them.\nAnonymity can sustain you. Anonymity can be your saving grace. Even a forced one, I imagine, might bring something good.\nA few months ago, I met Jhoanna Lynn Cruz, who threw herself into her own spiritual wilderness in Davao after a broken marriage. She brought with her her two children. She didn\u0026rsquo;t know a single soul in that large city. Malaria got her son twice and made her want to give up. But she stayed. She persevered and now calls herself a Mindanaoan.\nSometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s better to start over.\nSurprisingly, I am also sustained by this morning rush. This blood flows from my arteries to my veins when I open my eyes and get out of bed. Full of innocence, these children playing on the streets of Los Baños this early morning are the blood that flows into this town\u0026rsquo;s arteries.\nAnd what of the sari-sari stores that are our bridge to the factories that make our food, soap, shampoo, and other things that become the cells of our body, that become, at one point, us? Do they not sustain us, too?\nLast year, on the day my best friend was buried, a storm came so strong that the entire Los Baños electric power system came down for around three days. Most areas in the town also didn\u0026rsquo;t have running water. Mt. Data Street, where I live, surprisingly, had flowing water. But that was it. We used to rely on an electric stove. Without electricity, we cannot eat. Rain was nonstop, and many of the streets I now walk lay underwater.\nWe got by through processed, packaged food bought in the store. This is the Philippines. This is nothing new. But it is still worth writing about.\nThese stores, perhaps inherited from the Chinese (but we call them the Spanish word garita in Pangasinan, which warrants some research), are so prevalent we\u0026rsquo;ve refused to even think about them. We try our best to avoid them if we can. All those sachets hanging inside the sari-sari store, along with all those sugar wrapped around with colorful plastic, are more expensive by a few pesos compared to those we buy in the grocery. And yet when I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of a long essay that has to be written, and I\u0026rsquo;m sleepy of hunger and no food is in the fridge, I walk toward the humble sari-sari store near my house.\nHere at Mt. Data Street, the white, fat dog who once stood out from all the others is now overrun by scabies. He frequently sits and turns his upper body behind his back to scratch the scabies with his mouth. He sits on clear, pristine roads, cleaned by house owners. Here in LB, the street segment in front of your house is yours. You park your car in front of it if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a garage. If you own no car, this is still an unspoken rule: you clean the segment of that road. Walkers like me will forever thank you for it.\nTiny dogs often bark at me when I walk here. They constantly remind me that I can\u0026rsquo;t have a dog unless I want my life to get more complicated. The night I left Pangasinan to relocate to Los Baños, I left two dogs at our family\u0026rsquo;s house in Pangasinan. I will never see one of them again.\nThe first place I rented while looking for a more permanent place to stay was a large room on the second floor of an apartment complex. The floor was wooden, and I smelled the cigarette smoke from the single mother renting below me.\nA cat befriended me, a tilapia colored female, while there, so I felt obliged to buy food for her. Later, a second cat, a black and white female, appeared. I shooed her at first but felt bad about myself for doing so. I decided to treat them equally.\nWhen I left that room after two months of renting and finding the unit I am now renting, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t wrap myself around the thought of leaving the two cats. So, I took them with me. I remember hiring a tricycle driver and sitting inside while holding between my legs a large cage with the two cats loudly meowing around Lopez Ave., Santos Street, and finally Data Street. It is one of the most expensive decisions I have made with my life here. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I could\u0026rsquo;ve survived that first year in Los Baños without the friendship of these two cats.\nIt is 7 a.m. now. I\u0026rsquo;ve been walking for 30 minutes. I hear the sound of the train from afar. Perhaps this is the first train to arrive today. A train arrives at 7 in the morning and 7 in the evening, with others arriving intermittently in between. Of course, the train from Manila and traverses Laguna, bound to as far as Bicol, has been passing by Los Baños for over a century. When I arrived here in 2021, there was no train, however. It only resumed operation this year, if I\u0026rsquo;m not mistaken.\nWhen I first heard the train one morning, I was too ignorant I thought it was the water pipe in our bathroom, which sounded similar when broken. Another time, I mistook it for the sound of our blender. Only after seeing the train one evening while walking at IPB Road and hearing the same sound did I finally figure out what is too obvious to many.\nIt rained yesterday—torrents of it. So, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t expecting all this sun. Often, LB gives a lot of sun briefly for 30 minutes in the early morning before it rains for the entire day. The brief sun we are given in the morning is a gift. We have to wake up early just to have our clothes dried. When I see clouds beginning to move fast, I rush to the clothesline.\nHopefully, this sun lasts.\nWhen you see tarps of the recently graduated, especially those with the words cum laude on them, you remember it is a university town, after all. Dorms usually have these tarps. When dorms hang these, I interpret this as them saying that, somehow, what made these good souls succeed in their studies is the warmth of their beds, the security of their rooms, the friendliness of their landlords, perhaps. Once in a while, you\u0026rsquo;ll see one of these tarps hanging from a house or a business establishment: Son of the owner. Daughter of the owner. And you can\u0026rsquo;t help but think, she\u0026rsquo;s from here. She studied here, when will she ever leave?\nSometimes, I wonder which is more important for Los Baños, which brings more business to folks: the school or the baths? Living too far from the baths to feel their presence consistently, I tend to think the school is more important. But both the school and the baths have the power to draw traffic.\nThe reason why it was so easy to adopt cats in LB is because there are too many of them on the streets it\u0026rsquo;s almost a thing here to adopt at least one. No other place in the world has such a love of cats.\nA few months ago, one of the cats inside the University of the Philippines campus got hit by a car. It died right away. Students built an altar of flowers for the cat near the spot where it got killed, which stayed there for about a week. People came by to pay their respects or to take photos. I heard they are still on a manhunt for the suspect. That is how much people love cats here.\nThis makes me sad when I hear that live kittens are sometimes left inside drums or under bushes, crying for days before they die. Perhaps such is the paradox of place.\nLos Baños streets are uncharitable for walkers. They\u0026rsquo;re too small and yet hold too many cars. Except inside UP, most streets have no sidewalks. Even narrow streets can be surprisingly busy sometimes.\nI love empty roads with no cars or those not too busy. They make me feel like they were designed especially for walkers: an oasis in a town intoxicated with cars.\nI reach Ruby and it is now past 8:00. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer alone. Students walk with me, tiptoeing over wet stones and going to the road\u0026rsquo;s edge to avoid cars and tricycles. I wish I could walk for my parents and family again like these students do now.\nWe pass by apartments for rent and laundry houses near them. In Banawe Street, the front yard of a house was turned into an eatery. A few blocks away at Sapphire, a family opened a restaurant in their garage. This is a town built for students. There is a budget price for almost anything. Incidentally, those who choose to live cheaply while they do their art find solace in a town made for students.\nI walk slowly to savor the smell of butter on rice.\nBut it isn\u0026rsquo;t students alone who walk here in the morning. I share the road with some of those who just came from work. And these are blue-collar workers, men in slippers, eyes sleepy, hugged by tight sweatshirts.\nI pass this compound at Banawe Street with a large bungalow house and cat cage outside. The cage has several floors, and pet bowls and beds are on each floor. There are no cats now. I wonder whether this is a shelter for cats or a property of the Cats of UPLB.\nI heard neighbors joking around and laughing as I felt a sudden increase in the volume of people walking. It\u0026rsquo;s about 9:00 am. I feel a slight change of mood within me. From gratefulness, I now welcome a feeling of survival. Along with all of these, the sun has grown hotter.\nIt seems that it will be a sunny day after all.\nThere is a weird-looking apartment complex on Mt. Pulog Street. I like to call it the castle. Spiral stairs that connect floors are like towers of a fort. That is too much brick on a building. No one would dare build something like this now; it must have been here long ago.\nSpeaking of Mt. Pulog Street, this name is a typo. There is no such thing as a mountain in the Philippines named Pulog. This is Mt. Pulag, one of the many peaks up north in the Cordillera. But who cares? The name has worked for many for a long time already, nobody bothers anymore. I, too, call the street Pulog.\nAside from its name, there are other funny things to behold on this street: cut plastic bottles made bulbs for lights on fences. And as if that wasn’t enough, someone was riding his bike with a loudspeaker playing.\nLos Baños is an old place with old people. Old people like fallen twigs, like these quiet houses.\nSomething has to be said about water meters. Often left outside compounds alone and only checked once a month, they are one of the loneliest objects ever invented.\nIn 2021, my first year here, a garbage collector stepped on my water meter to get over our fence. I bet he was eyeing to get a piece of metal or wood lying around our front yard. He never made it over the fence. Instead, he broke my water meter and my water pipe. For the next three days, I fetched water from my neighbor’s faucet while waiting for the water company to come to repair what was broken.\nWhat was really broken was my faith in the scrap men who ride their tricycles around. It took me a while to regain my respect for them. But when I did, I started a conversation with one. It was in the middle of a tight lockdown. I asked him how often he moves around buying metal and scraps. He said he harbors ill feelings for the present mayor for only giving them the weekends to earn their living. I empathized with him.\nAbove Mt. Makiling Street is an open vacant lot with trees and bamboo. It is elevated. I see below it the roofs of houses. I rested here as a strong cold breeze blew, comforting my perspiring body. From afar, dogs bark.\nI am grateful for students saving the businesses here.\nI am grateful to the river for its patience.\nI am grateful for mothers waiting for their children outside the school gate.\nI am grateful for a local government that seems to be functioning.\nI am grateful for this sidewalk.\nI am grateful for drivers who stop for pedestrians crossing.\n9:30 am on Lopez Ave. I hear the train once more.\nJust now, I used the viewfinder to take a photo of this leaf. There is something about using the viewfinder that is magical, almost mystical. The little box is a meditation on objects and our interdependence with them.\nThese long walks are like seiza. You let yourself be sucked by images and thoughts worthy of being written later. But then you remind yourself that you are walking. You remember the main task at hand. It centers you. This is particularly useful when you start to feel impatient with the heat, tiredness, or boredom.\nI pass by balitbitan trees, and the memories of my first weeks here return.\nTheory: The houses on the right of Lopez Ave. going to UP are those of locals who have lived here for so long, while the estates on the left are subdivisions and apartment complexes made for those staying in Los Baños temporarily.\nA friend said that half of Halcon Street is privately owned. The land owner was intent on making this as clear as possible that he placed tens of large concrete barrels on half of the road. This effectively deterred motorists from avoiding the road. It is a perfect reminder of how far one can go in protecting his property.\nThere is a single mosque in Los Baños (as far as I’m aware of): the IMSA Jammi Al-khair at Bulusan Street. One of the best moments of my stay here was my first Christmas Eve morning when I heard the Imam sing.\nI stopped to take a photo of the mosque, which reminded me that it took me a while before I felt comfortable pointing my camera at it. It was an afternoon last year. The imam was also singing, and the dogs were howling with him. I took my phone out of my pocket and grabbed a photo of its beautiful blue dome. I felt ashamed of fearing what was different. This is why I’m so grateful for walking. It shows me my blind spots.\nWhat sustains me in Los Baños?\nJericho’s pandesal and the occasional Micha’s.\nMt.

It is called Roots x Gravel (read: roots by gravel). It begins tomorrow, Monday, December 4.\nFor seven days, I’ll be re-walking some of my walking routes here in Los Baños, the university town where I currently live. At the end of each day, I’ll send a dispatch of words and images that I’ll put together using prompts I pick up during the walk.\nAs a subscriber to The Long Walk, you’ll automatically receive the daily emails for seven days starting tomorrow. However, if you would rather not receive them, please go to your Substack account through this link, navigate to notifications, and turn off “Root x Gravel.”\nSince this is a pop-up newsletter, I’ll delete it after sending a final email on December 11, 2023.\nIn January 2021, after almost a year of isolation, I decided to beat travel restrictions and relocate to a town in Southern Luzon famous for its hot spring resorts. Los Baños (literally, “The Baths”) has become my home for the past three years. While I’ve walked many other places in the past, it is here in Los Baños where I truly fell in love with the art of walking.\nFor the first time in my three years here, I ought to further deepen my connection with this place through an intensive seven days of focused walking, photography, and writing.\nHere are some rules to guide the walk:\nI’ll begin the week with a question: What sustains me in Los Baños? While this question begins the project, it won’t necessarily finish with it. I’ll let the thoughts and images that come during the walks shape the entire course of the project. Each walk shall be a practice of radical listening. Although an initial question guides me, my main goal is to listen deeply to whatever comes after and beyond it. I will refrain from imposing theories on my contemplations and writings during the walk. I’ll simply listen to what the walks will tell me. The walk will be solitary. To really hear myself, I won’t be walking with anyone. Interactions with others will come naturally through the walks. There will be no internet or social media access during the walks. Updates will only be sent via this newsletter. Perhaps a few photos will be shared via Instagram at the end of the day, but that would be it. I’ll begin walking by 6:00 a.m. and attempt to finish before lunchtime. If more time is needed, I’ll give myself until 3:00 p.m., but nothing more. Evenings will be spent writing and editing photos for the missives. I’ll walk as slowly as necessary. There is no need to cover all the routes for seven days. I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing at least two more of these walks next year any way, so no need to rush. Why am I doing this?\nI’m doing it because I’ve never done it before. I’m doing it because I set this as a goal for 2023, and 2023 is dwindling away fast. But more importantly, I’m doing this to honor Los Baños for everything it has given me for the past three years. This is one of the few places in the Philippines where I felt like people actually cared about their neighbors and the place they inhabit. For me, it is the perfect place to explore the subsistent spirituality I’ve been writing about recently and see how this place shapes the life I’ve been trying to build here. While this is a deeply personal project, I hope it will be helpful to some of you.\nThere is a communal gap that the project also hopes to address. Writings about Los Baños are surprisingly scarce. Believe it or not, no dedicated history book has been written about this town. Available books about it only tell about the World War II Japanese internment camp that once existed inside the University of the Philippines campus, the successful raid that Americans conducted to liberate the Western prisoners in the camp, and the violent retaliation by the Japanese against the local people that came after the raid. Contemporary writings about Los Baños are scattered around travel blogs and academic lectures. Writings about Los Baños, particularly an intimate portrait of the place and one’s experience of it, are yet to be written. I had these thoughts in mind as I was conceptualizing Roots x Gravel.\nSo, I hope you’ll join me on this week-long walk and tell others who may want to join us as well. I can’t wait to see what we’ll find on the road tomorrow.\nYours in walking,\nV\n","date":"3 December 2023","permalink":"/tlw/025/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"A Seven-day Walk Around Los Baños"},{"content":"A trip to Baguio last October left me in a tunnel filled with doubts about where I was heading. I wanted November to show me the way out. I knew I needed help, so I typed the URL of Andrew James Brown\u0026rsquo;s website, navigated to the contact form, and pasted the message I drafted on my note-taking app.\nAndrew, the first religious minister I ever paid attention to since 2012, is an atheist, and yet he leads a church in the United Kingdom. I was wandering around the spiritual wilderness for more than a decade, but I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard about an atheist pastor. I would later learn that atheism is prevalent even among many conservative churches, but it is especially welcomed and nurtured in the liberal religious movement called unitarianism. If there is any way for me to reconcile my past as a devout JW with my heavily secular and agnostic present, a necessity I discovered I had to do after a relatively long walk last year, that way would be found only within liberal religion.\nSeiza #I asked Andrew how one begins walking in this creative, free spirituality. In his generous response, he suggested trying seiza, a Japanese word that, based on current usage, refers to both the traditional and formal Japanese sitting posture and the meditation method Torajiro Okada (1872–1920) introduced using the same posture. I\u0026rsquo;ve been practicing zazen, primarily by myself, since 2017, so I\u0026rsquo;m familiar with the process. The main difference between seiza and zazen besides posture is that seiza never really developed doctrines, sacred texts, rituals, or a lineage of teachers, which Zen Buddhism has. Seiza is purely a method and appeals more to practitioners who care more about sitting meditation than religious teachings.\nPracticing seiza for a month has taught me a lot about being mindful of my posture, especially when writing. I noticed that I breathe and think better when my spine is erect. Better thinking easily translates to better writing. More importantly, seiza introduced me to two new people I now see as partners in this creative, free spirituality I\u0026rsquo;m exploring. In November, I attended three seiza group meditation sessions via Zoom, led by Miki Nakura, a Jōdo Shinshū Buddhist minister familiar with the liberal religious movement. In one of those sessions, I sat silently with Andrew James Brown.\nShinichiro Imaoka (1881–1988) #Andrew also advised looking into the life of Shinichiro Imaoka (1881–1988), dubbed the Emerson of Japan and the proponent of a uniquely Eastern liberal religious concept called \u0026ldquo;jiyū shūkyō.\u0026rdquo; Imaoka was raised a Pureland Buddhist but later converted to Anglicanism, Congregationalism, and Unitarianism before embracing his spiritual philosophy of free religion. Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s life and conversions were detailed in a biography by George Williams called Cosmic Sage.\nImaoka didn\u0026rsquo;t leave us a clear definition of free religion, so it can be challenging to explain the concept. However, reading and reflecting on Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s Principles of Living helps one understand free religion better. It is what I did per Andrew\u0026rsquo;s advice.\nHowever, the absence of a clear definition of free religion should be seen as an asset of the idea: anyone learning about it could create their own interpretation. I did this through my essay \u0026ldquo; A Goodness Lurking: The Quest for a Free, Subsistent Spirituality.\u0026rdquo;\nThe way I understand it, religion and spirituality should always be free or, at the very least, aspire for freedom. Therefore, free religion will always be the ideal. For religion to be free, however, it has to be deeply personal. Although this is all semantics, using the word \u0026ldquo;spirituality\u0026rdquo; makes the subject more personal. Spirituality should be as simple and prevalent as possible. It has to be seen in as many human endeavors as possible, so I am partial to the idea that spirituality is simply an attitude of deeply caring about something. It is an attitude expressed and cultivated through different spiritual practices.\nWriting as Ministry #One of the things that made my trip to Baguio difficult last October was that what was originally a walk to search for a Middle-Eastern restaurant became a walk down memory lane as I passed streets I frequented as a JW minister. The question I\u0026rsquo;ve been asking myself since I decided to confront the past I was running away from was this: What is it in my past life as a JW minister that worked for me that I could use and integrate into my current life as an agnostic who is still profoundly spiritual?\nOne of the most obvious things I missed in my past life as a JW was the strong sense of purpose I used to have and the clear path toward realizing that purpose. Everything was about God, and the path was simple: I just had to follow the rules, perform acts of devotion, and do the ministry. The ministry was a form of service that benefited a specific group of people in my experience, the Deaf and Hard of hearing community in Baguio, many of whom I taught sign language as a way to introduce the Church\u0026rsquo;s teachings.\nAfter reading about Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s quest and Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s life, I knew I needed to reframe my life into a similar structure. I needed a ministry, a way to serve others. But what? Thinking about this made me realize that this was the closest I\u0026rsquo;ve ever come to feeling like a religious person again after giving that all up in 2012.\nWhere do I look for my ministry? First, I looked at what I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing and see how I can convert it into a personal ministry. I even entertained the idea of joining a new religion and considering a pastoral path.\nBut then, I realized that after leaving a ministerial and pastoral life, what preoccupied most of my 20s was an exploration of writing. It was mostly an untrained writing life. I began by tracking my mood every day in a large notebook during the weeks of my depressive episode. Then I discovered blogging and blogged my life into the world. Journaling came only after I realized writing on paper was its own experience. I was primarily self-taught, and most of my writing was highly personal. And yet, it was a writing life nonetheless. My relationship with writing is so personal and too spiritual that I only came out this year and tried my luck with my very first workshop at age 31.\nIn my journal entry dated 2023-11-23, I began to dream:\n\u0026ldquo;While I adhere to free religion, I don\u0026rsquo;t think being a pastor is really for me. I am not close to the possibility. But I am currently so in love with writing that it is what\u0026rsquo;s calling me strongest right now. The only difference now is that aside from a personal writing practice, I intend to write with others together. I see writing as a vehicle to fulfill my ministry as a serious writer and a writing teacher following the tradition of the writing process movement.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd so, I asked: why not convert writing itself into a form of ministry? I liked the sound of this idea. But how does one convert writing into a form of ministry?\nThe first thing I did was to return to spiritual writing. Spiritual writing is something widely explored by the American Transcendentalists, a group led by no other than Emerson himself, Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s hero of free religion. According to Lawrence Buell in his book Literary Transcendentalism, one of the things the transcendentalists explored in the nineteenth century was how writing can both be a tool to go deeper into transcendentalism (i.e., to live a unique ethical life) and a vehicle to express the creative genius they believe reside within every human being.\nThese goals make sense. For writing to become a spiritual and religious practice, it has to help one strengthen one\u0026rsquo;s spirituality while simultaneously helping one express that spirituality through words.\nSomething was missing here, though. What the transcendentalists did with writing was turn it into a spiritual practice. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a ministry. A ministry is a service; one must identify who to minister to. Although I love the solitary experience of writing and the challenge of improving my craft, I missed working directly with people, something I did with the Deaf in the past. How can I convert writing into a ministry that allows me to experience a similar direct connection with others?\nEnter Pat Schneider. I discovered her after her book How the Light Gets In appeared in my research on spiritual writing. While reading the Wikipedia entry about her, I learned that she developed a relatively popular writing method known as the Amherst Writers and Artists (AWA) method after the group that Schneider started. The technique was detailed in Schneider\u0026rsquo;s book Writing Alone and With Others, which I am currently reading. I have yet to finish it, but I am starting to agree with Peter Below, who wrote the Foreword of the book when he said that Schneider might be \u0026ldquo;the wisest teacher of writing I know.\u0026rdquo;\nSchneider used the AWA writing method in creating writing groups for writers from different walks of life and writing workshops for those who wanted to deepen their craft. What interests and inspires me the most is that Schneider started writing groups for low-income women and children and those in prison. Schneider passionately believes that everyone is a writer and that writing is a powerful method for self-actualization for all.\nThe AWA method espouses the following five essential affirmations.\nEveryone has a strong, unique voice. Everyone is born with creative genius. Writing as an art form belongs to all people, regardless of economic class or educational level. The teaching of craft can be done without damage to a writer’s original voice or artistic self-esteem. A writer is someone who writes. I have yet to articulate fully how I intend to combine a personal writing practice with a writing ministry with the AWA method as an inspiration. I have yet to express how to infuse my writing practice with the creative, free, subsistent spirituality I\u0026rsquo;m exploring.\nFor now, here\u0026rsquo;s a journal entry I wrote about this:\nThis sitting down on the floor in front of a small Japanese table you bought surplus over a shade of dim sunlight to write on a new page is love. It is faith. It is believing that you still have something to say to the world, even if you\u0026rsquo;re unsure what it is. It is believing that something good, something necessary, will come out of writing. And for someone who refuses the idea of submitting to a big brother in the sky, this is the only true act of faith.\nThis is grit. Doing it not out of joy but out of belief. The world is not here to make you happy. It is not here to serve you. It is here to slap you on the face so you can see happiness lurking behind the moss-covered crevices of your soul. To pursue only things that make you happy is hollow—hollow as the cage that it is.\nTherefore, the first principle is to believe that this world is worth walking, no matter how bleak the evidence for it. The practice is to simply wake up in the morning and trust. This is all the work that has to happen. A journal entry begins with faith and ends with joyful expectation.\n","date":"2 December 2023","permalink":"/uman/013/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 013 — November 2023"},{"content":" It has been told that the historian Arnold Toynbee once visited the Ise Grand Shrine of Japan. The Ise Grand Shrine, also known as Ise Jingū, is a network of several Shinto shrines scattered around Mie Prefecture and encircling two main shrines, Naikū and Gekū. It was perhaps after seeing these two shrines that Toynbee wrote the following words on the visitor\u0026rsquo;s logbook: \u0026ldquo;I feel in this holy place the underlying unity of all religions.\u0026rdquo;\nI encountered this account in \u0026ldquo;What is [[jiyu shukyo]]?\u0026rdquo; one of the seven selected writings of [[shinichiro imaoka|Shin\u0026rsquo;ichirō Imaoka]] featured in the appendix of [[cosmic sage williams|Cosmic Sage]], George Williams\u0026rsquo; biography of who was once called \u0026ldquo;the Emerson of Japan.\u0026rdquo; In the same essay, Imaoka mentioned that the visit of a famous Buddhist poet, Saigyo, to the same shrine moved him to write a poem in tears for \u0026ldquo;something divine and inexplicable.\u0026rdquo; Imaoka then concluded that both Toynbee and Saigyo are \u0026ldquo;free religionists\u0026rdquo; as they perceived the sublime across religious boundaries and that Shinto, the natural religion of the Japanese people, is a form of free religion as it moves anyone visiting regardless of their religious background into an appreciation of what it means to be human.\nThese accounts tell me that spirituality is a lot simpler and more accessible than what most of us make it to be. I am very interested in understanding and articulating this simple spirituality because my personal history with religion and spirituality has led me to an unexpected state where I\u0026rsquo;m not ready to join a church or any form of institutional faith. Yet, I describe myself as very spiritual and perhaps even very religious.\nMy gut tells me that any church or group can never monopolize spirituality. It can be institutionalized, but it will never be caged. This is because spirituality is primarily a personal matter that relies heavily on an individual\u0026rsquo;s subjective experience. Furthermore, as [[scott barry kaufman|Scott Barry Kaufman]] would agree, spirituality is more prevalent in the population. All human beings are born with a natural predisposition to be spiritual. I will explain more later.\nThe Two Farmers #When I was still living in my hometown in Pangasinan, I used to walk every afternoon on this long and winding road about ten minutes away from our house by bicycle. Whenever I reach the beginning of the trail, I get off my bike and start walking. The walk begins around four and ends around six when the sun completely sets. I would sit on the side of the road, usually on the grass, to watch the sun go down.\nAround this time, farmers, some of whom I know, begin their way home. One farmer goes home riding a kuliglig (cart pulled by an engine) with some hay behind him. Another rides his small, rusty bike. Many walk, especially those living in small huts just along the road.\nMost farmers would not care to look at the sunset. Looking forward to a tasty dinner after a long, tiresome day under the sun, most are eager to reach home. But once, I witnessed two farmers walking across the field via a pilalipil (dike) as the sun was a few seconds away from disappearing behind the mountains of Zambales. Something moved the first man to stop and watch the sun. The man following him did the same and placed his arm around his companion\u0026rsquo;s shoulders. They joined me from afar in paying homage to this giant ball of fire that tirelessly feeds us and the crops around us with nurturing light day after day.\nWhen I went home that evening, I contemplated what made those two farmers different from all the other farmers I\u0026rsquo;d seen throughout my many walks. I also thought about what makes me think deeply about perennial questions that don\u0026rsquo;t bother many of those I encounter daily.\nSpirituality is an Attitude of Deeply Caring #It is no complete and conclusive answer, but I am partial to the idea that spirituality, at its core, is simply a way of seeing the world and being in it. In other words, it is an attitude. Specifically, spirituality is an attitude of deeply caring as opposed to an attitude of indiscriminate apathy.\nWalker-writer [[craig mod|Craig Mod]] sometimes differentiates the United States (his country of origin) from Japan (his country of residence) by using the word \u0026ldquo;care\u0026rdquo; to describe the latter. After describing Japan\u0026rsquo;s pro-people social systems, such as its health system and social services that make it easier for the Japanese to pursue creative and entrepreneurial pursuits, Mod would argue that these systems reflect a people who \u0026ldquo;care\u0026rdquo; about others. This culture of caring flows from Shinto itself, the Japanese natural spirituality or way of life.\nThis predisposition to care is at the root of spirituality. We are born with it. It begins with ourselves. It is within our nature to care about the self, preserve it, and seek its flourishing. At the same time, as early as childhood, we can direct this attitude of deeply caring to things outside of ourselves: to a caregiver, a pet, a stranger, or even an inanimate toy.\nA closer look at the idea that spirituality is simply an attitude of deeply caring tells me a few things about what spirituality is.\nSpirituality is active. Attitude is a word that involves both a feeling about something and an expressed behavior toward it. This is exactly what spirituality is. It begins within but always seeks to get out of the confines of the self. It constantly seeks action and expression. Interestingly, the attitude of deeply caring (i.e., spirituality) is often maintained through active practice, whether meditation, praying, writing, or physically active practice, such as walking or yoga. Without this active practice, the attitude could weaken. Spirituality is dynamic. Although I naturally can deeply care about myself and others, I won\u0026rsquo;t always express it. It opens then closes only to open again. In my parable of the two farmers, the farmers who didn\u0026rsquo;t stop to look at the sunset are not necessarily \u0026ldquo;non-spiritual.\u0026rdquo; As human beings, they, without a doubt, deeply care about something. They may not care about the sunset but feel strongly about their wives and children and act toward them with the most significant expression of care—love. This, of course, is profoundly spiritual. Spirituality keeps on changing; it shape-shifts. So, we can never fully institutionalize it or put rules around it. It will always break free from those rules. Spirituality is object-neutral. To emphasize the point I just made above, the object of my attitude of deep care could be different from yours. I could deeply care about my craft of writing while you deeply care about a loved one or a principle. Since spirituality is simply the attitude we direct toward something, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t choose its object. We do the choosing, and we can channel it toward anything. Spirituality is pluralistic. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to direct our attitude of deeply caring toward a single thing or person. My life is too complex to focus on just one thing or one person. The nature of my life necessitates that I deeply care about many things simultaneously. Some will take more of my attention and care than others at any given moment, but the object of my care could change at any time. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to burden myself with chaining my devotion to a single being. Spirituality is medium-neutral. My brand of spirituality can be expressed in different ways. A minister expresses it through preaching, an artist through her works, a meditator through meditation, a philosopher through logic, and the farmer through his crops. Since the attitude of deeply caring is highly subjective, each individual chooses how best to express it based on their strengths and tendencies. Spirituality is not nurtured by a single method alone. There is no ladder to climb, only various spokes connecting to the center of a wheel. Also, I am multifaceted, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to choose a single medium to express my deep care. I could explore and use different media across cultures and traditions to express my spirituality. Spirituality is subsistent. Taken simply as an attitude, my spirituality does not need a lot. It merely requires an object of deep care and a medium of expressing that deep care. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask me to follow stringent rules. It simply requests that I be my most loving and caring self toward others. Spirituality is accessible. Since it is simply an attitude and doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask a lot from us, it is more accessible to anyone, regardless of their cultural and religious background. Spirituality can be owned by those who attend church and those who don\u0026rsquo;t. It can be owned by those who believe in a personal God and those who do not. Spirituality is portable. Since it is simply an attitude, I can carry it wherever I go. I could call upon it at any time. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to be in a specific \u0026ldquo;holy\u0026rdquo; place to activate it. I don\u0026rsquo;t need a pastor or a guru to call it forth. It is always with me like a shadow. Spirituality is inclusive. The lesser the requirements for spirituality, the wider a net it can cast to include as much of human life in it. Seen simply as an attitude of deeply caring about something, we allow it to include as many diverse people as possible. Spirituality as an Alternative to Apathy and Suicide #But why do we need an adjective like \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; to label an attitude of deep caring?\nI need a label because I know that it is easy to slide into the way of apathy, a life characterized by not caring about anything at all, sometimes even to oneself. Apathy could lead to thoughts that life is no longer worth living. I\u0026rsquo;ve been in that place several times in my short life, and it is a place I hope to never return to again. I am intent on distancing myself from that place, and I need to remind myself of the better alternative constantly. A label, such as \u0026ldquo;spiritual,\u0026rdquo; can be a useful mnemonic device.\nI need to emphasize at this point that the desire to end one\u0026rsquo;s life should never be taken as a sign of a person\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;spiritual\u0026rdquo; weakness, as is often the view in many institutionalized religions. My depression and the suicidal ideations that came with it and returned on two occasions (the end of my six-year relationship in 2018 and the coming of my tinnitus in 2020) have taught me that most, if not all of us who have, at one point, decided to kill ourselves, did so out of our intense longing to end our suffering. Suicide is often seen as a way out of suffering, not life. Remove the suffering and the suicidal will always want to continue living.\nAnd this is why, I think, the question of suicide is so important, if not central, to an understanding of spirituality. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t talk about spirituality without talking about the most existential of all questions: \u0026ldquo;Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I kill myself?\u0026rdquo;\nFor me, spirituality (the attitude of deeply caring) is impossible without taking a courageous leap of faith in the goodness lurking behind every tiny crevice of a universe that can be so quickly filled with darkness. The evidence for a world that is beautiful and good is often missing that one needs to believe it is there.\nWhy shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I kill myself? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t, but I trust that if I avoid this thought for just one day, I will find something to convince me to begin \u0026ldquo;caring\u0026rdquo; again. This is the simplest yet most profound example of faith I could ever think of.\nOnce one trusts the goodness lurking out there, one begins to care about oneself, others, society, and the world. Spirituality, this attitude of deeply caring about life in general and specific objects (i.e., people, activities, things, etc.) in particular, becomes this constant practice that strengthens our conviction on the goodness of life as we face many forms of suffering. In other words, once spirituality kindles faith to goodness, it becomes a fuel that will continue to feed the fire of faith. Through it, the will to survive, to exist, is reinforced.\nWriting this reminds me of why I like using the word \u0026ldquo;subsistent\u0026rdquo; to describe the kind of spirituality I\u0026rsquo;m proposing here. The word subsistent is primarily used to describe a condition that allows one to continue to exist (i.e., to get by). At the same time, it also refers to something that thrives on minimal resources.\nThis is the spirituality that I aspire for—a subsistent spirituality that will allow me to continue to believe in the worthiness of living and that is so lightweight that I can run with it freely with the winds of life.\nA Free, Subsistent Spirituality #I first heard of the term \u0026ldquo;subsistence spirituality\u0026rdquo; from Barbara Brown Taylor, a former episcopal minister who left church life to pursue teaching. She describes this spirituality as \u0026ldquo;a way of being with God and one another that is lean enough to live in the wilderness for as long as necessary.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a talk, she described what that \u0026ldquo;wilderness\u0026rdquo; looks like:\nIn the beginning, you weep. Because all the familiar landmarks are gone. Because you don’t know where you are. Because the only food left in your backpack is disgusting. And the little bit of water in your canteen has turned green. You’re hungry, you’re tired, you’re lost, you’re alone, it’s getting dark. And even if the sky is clear enough for stars tonight, you don’t know how to read them. You always meant to, but you never learned. So now what? If you’re a pray-er, you pray. If you’re not a pray-er, you pray. What else can you do once you’ve come to the end of what you can do for yourself? It’s time to find out what faith means out beyond the boundaries of where you were warned not to go.\nYou know that I also use the word [[wilderness|wilderness]] in my writings. I use it to refer to unexplored (or un-walked) geographic space ([[thoughts/geographical wilderness|geographical wilderness]]) and unexplored areas of thought and ideas ([[thoughts/mental wilderness|mental wilderness]]). Walking on both geographical and mental wildernesses leads one to experience the wilderness akin to but to a lesser degree to Taylor\u0026rsquo;s description. However, what Taylor describes above is a third kind of wilderness—a spiritual wilderness.\nOur very existence is a wilderness experience. The universe is like a vast expanse, and we\u0026rsquo;ve been thrown into it. Not only were we thrown into existence outside our volition, we also received no guidance to prepare us for what is to come. That said, we have something natural within us that keeps us going for the first few years of our lives. As children, we were naturally curious and explorative. In other words, we inherited a natural tendency to trust and care for others, the world, and ourselves.\nBut as we grew older, this natural faith and attitude of deep care slowly disappeared. Children who face unimaginable suffering lose this attitude even earlier than usual. For many of us, a crisis completely removes the veil of faith that protects us from the violent wilderness. This crisis pushes us to confront questions we never thought to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of all these? Why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t I kill myself?\nWhen our childhood faith and deep care are gone, we are left to do the hard work of rebuilding it. This rebuilding process begins with a spark of faith. The spark could come from even a brief glimpse of beauty in nature. It could come from a kind gesture from a stranger or a loved one. Sometimes, it could be a rational conclusion. Whatever form it takes, it will be enough to save you from yourself.\nInterestingly, in the deepest, darkest valleys of one\u0026rsquo;s spiritual wilderness, institutionalized spirituality\u0026rsquo;s rules, doctrines, and rituals do very little to get one through. What saves one is always something more humble.\nFinding My Free, Subsistent Spirituality #All I write here are based on my experiences, which I continue to understand better as I age.\nI remember a vibrant childhood. I cared deeply about a lot of things. I had faith in my parents, relatives, the church we attended, and the world. As I grew up and experienced grief after grief (first, the loss of a pet, then the loss of my grandmother), I began to slowly understand that the world isn\u0026rsquo;t always good to me.\nAround high school, I began deepening my personal study of the Bible and the publications of my church. This propelled me to an intensely religious life at college, culminating in becoming a ministerial servant (a young pastor) for the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses. The spirituality I built for myself and the community that supported me shielded me from the suffering I saw around me. But that spirituality required a lot from me. It required that I attend meetings twice a week, give 70 hours each month to preach, give some of my allowance to the church, study the Bible, pray, and prepare and deliver talks in the Kingdom Hall. On top of that, I needed to believe in an invisible God, submit to the authority of elders (all men) in the congregation, believe that my entire life was being guided by a dozen Americans in New York, fight any romantic attachment to anyone outside the church, fight urges to explore my sexuality, and fight other forms of \u0026ldquo;temptations\u0026rdquo; ever present in the world.\nWhile I felt good that I was doing God\u0026rsquo;s work and that I had a community that supported me, I often felt guilty about coming short of all the standards of the church. I often cried in my prayers.\nIn 2011, the universe launched me into my very first experience of the spiritual wilderness. A spiraling and excruciatingly painful depressive episode challenged not only my faith in God and his church but, frighteningly, even my faith in the worthiness of being alive. Only two weeks in that spiritual wilderness, it became clear to me that none of the training I received from my childhood religion, the hours of Bible study and preaching, and the friends who promised to support me at that difficult time could save me from my desire to kill myself.\nI am only alive today because of the kindness of my parents. I am only alive today because I noticed that whenever the air touched my face during long rides, I felt incredibly good. I am only alive today because whenever my parents brought me to the beach, I found solace near the waters. These are the little things that gave me faith in that difficult time. They were the reason why I built some courage and patience to wait for the meds to kick in finally.\nIn other words, the little things re-sparked my faith in the goodness that lurked behind the world and made me believe that life is still worth living despite all the suffering. From there, I began to care once more. I began to deeply care about others, the world, and myself.\nThis new lesson continued to sustain me even after the depressive episode. It helped me face the second spiritual wilderness I experienced when I decided to leave the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses a year after my depressive episode. In that second spiritual wilderness, I took an intensely minimal and careful approach to my spirituality. Yes, I explored different traditions and attended different groups, but I always took a skeptical approach. I took away what resonated with me but left the beliefs and rituals too heavy to carry around. I reasoned that leaving my childhood religion took away a lot from me, and I would like to honor that journey by ensuring that the next version of my spirituality is one I could truly call my own.\nIt has been over ten years since I entered this second spiritual wilderness. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t describe it as an ecstatic life. Yes, I\u0026rsquo;ve never felt as free as before. But the wilderness is a tough place to be in for obvious reasons. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you the same comfort you had back at the place you left. For me, the biggest challenge since embracing a free, subsistent spirituality has always been community. I discovered early on that in spiritual and religious circles, skepticism is often under-appreciated and even subtly discouraged. Most religious and spiritual groups require a strong measure of devotion that is always almost binding. Therefore, it can be difficult to find a community of people who would encourage the same free, subsistent spirituality that I have designed for myself. In fact, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until this year that I started connecting with individuals who share a similar desire to keep their spiritual lives as lean as possible so that the unnecessary accessories of devotion may never burden them and that they can keep their eyes on what truly matters—developing an attitude of deep caring toward oneself, one\u0026rsquo;s neighbor, society, and the entire universe.\n","date":"25 November 2023","permalink":"/tlw/024/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"A Goodness Lurking: The Quest for a Free, Subsistent Spirituality"},{"content":"Dear friends,\nI am writing to share an update on the trajectory of The Long Walk. As you may remember, I launched this newsletter on November 9, 2022, via Substack. Its tagline then was \u0026ldquo;Footprints from a philosophical and contemplative life.\u0026rdquo;\nIn its first eight issues, I released a weekly open diary that contained artifacts I found on my daily walks and studies. Although creating those first issues was fulfilling, they took too much time and effort to prepare, so I switched to a more sustainable strategy. I reverted to sharing works in progress in my Talahardin, a collection of notes in different writing genres and stages of development. I tried to share one poem, vignette, essay, or insight every week. I also returned to using Mailerlite as my email newsletter platform to retake greater control over the publication design.\nFrom day one, I intended to document my own long walk—a metaphor I use to refer to life itself—while touching on issues that I hoped would have a universal appeal to anyone reading. In the About page of the original Substack, I wrote:\nI have two main objectives in writing this newsletter. The first is to force me to make sense of the seemingly unconnected artifacts that often come to me in my reflections while studying or walking. The second is to leave intellectual footprints that others may use as archetypes or sources of inspiration for their intimate philosophical and contemplative journeys.\nI still feel strongly about these objectives. However, I have changed and grown over the past year of my long walk, and this change and growth had to be reflected in the publication.\nWith that in mind, here are some changes I\u0026rsquo;m instituting in this publication moving forward:\n1. I am returning to Substack. #Although Mailerlite allows more customizability than Substack, the company running it is losing integrity by the day, removing necessary functionalities that I have greatly depended on in their free tier. This makes it more difficult for someone like me, with a small audience of around a hundred people, to run a newsletter efficiently.\nMeanwhile, what Substack misses in customizability, it compensates through its ease of use and growing popularity. Some of you have found this newsletter through Substack\u0026rsquo;s promotional system alone. More importantly, Substack\u0026rsquo;s user-friendly interface allows me to focus on what matters the most: listening to the comings and goings of life, catching a few artifacts worthy of my attention, and sharing some of them with you, hoping they could be of some value to you.\n2. I am changing the tagline. #I am also changing the publication\u0026rsquo;s tagline from \u0026ldquo;Footprints from a philosophical and contemplative life\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Footprints from a philosophical and spiritual life.\u0026rdquo; The change is a way for me to be more explicit about the tectonic changes that have been happening within me in the past two years, which started with the long walk to San Pablo City.\nSince that walk, I\u0026rsquo;ve confronted the religious past that I have been trying to avoid for over a decade with honesty, trying to find clues to shed light on my path forward. The exercise led me to embrace a part of me that will never leave: a free, creative, religious, and spiritual self. Granted, I\u0026rsquo;ve avoided the words \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;spirituality\u0026rdquo; when describing who I am and what I am doing. I once felt that these words were too slippery and loaded to capture the minimal secular outlook that I\u0026rsquo;ve leaned on since leaving the Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses in 2012. Nonetheless, how I conduct my life and explore art shows a strong tendency to feel reverence and awe for reality and act intentionally according to these emotions. I now realize that this tendency can never be fully captured by the words \u0026ldquo;philosophical\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;contemplative.\u0026rdquo;\nI am still an agnostic. I still think this is all the life we have (i.e., there is no afterlife), and I shy away from talks of the supernatural. And yet, I am deeply in love with existence—mine, yours, ours—and I am moved to make the most out of this existence through intentional living and creativity. I intend to write more about my evolving relationship with the words religion and spirituality in the future. For now, I am changing this newsletter\u0026rsquo;s tagline to express my openness and acceptance of who I have always been.\n3. I will be exploring spirituality further. #In connection with #2, this newsletter shall become more explorative of this desire to construct a free, creative spirituality, to live it, and to test how this spirituality could inspire a unique artistic practice, mainly writing and photography (my two primary media).\nDuring the 20th Ateneo National Writers\u0026rsquo; Workshop, Luna Sicat Cleto told us that there are two writing genres largely unexplored and almost non-existent in the Philippines: nature writing and spiritual writing. As a Filipino writer attracted to nature and spirituality, I considered this a call to arms. Although the European romantics, the American transcendentalists, and classic Eastern spiritual writers are often looked down upon in contemporary literature, they are still the best resources for anyone exploring a writing practice that is both nourishing and expressive.\nAs I end this letter, I want to take this opportunity once more to thank you for paying attention to my words. Many of you found The Long Walk by meeting me in in-person gatherings and sharing a piece of our lives together. It was a privilege to have met you on your own long walk, and I sincerely desire to give back to you through my humble words, which I hope will always provide you comfort, no matter how small.\nWith the warmest of wishes,\nVince\n","date":"19 November 2023","permalink":"/tlw/023/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"What's Next For The Long Walk"},{"content":" Uman means “change.” It is a monthly newsletter I send every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life. It used to be a separate newsletter. But I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated it into The Long Walk. Read the archives here.\nEntering October, I expected it to be a quiet month. I had a single writing project that was not urgent, I had a couple of client works, and I was set to travel to visit my family.\nI should\u0026rsquo;ve known by now that it is when life is quiet, when the ghosts of past lives come to visit us.\nEpistolary Essays on Walking #I mentioned last [[uman 2023-08|August]] that [[jesa suganob|Jesa Suganob]] and I are collaborating on a writing project exploring [[04 notes/walking]] through epistolary essays.

We\u0026rsquo;ve began exchanging impressions about each other\u0026rsquo;s work and are currently discussing how best to move the project forward.

In case you missed them, here they are:\n[[a midsummer rain in lb|A Midsummer Rain in LB]] (poem) [[approach life with humor|Approach life with humor]] (note) Photography via Darktable #Inspired by the solar punk artists behind Hundred Rabbits I\u0026rsquo;m starting to veer away from expensive subscription-based photography software like Lightroom and Photoshop in lieu of free and open-source software like Darktable. It\u0026rsquo;s surprisingly easy to use and arguably even more powerful than Lightroom. The photos from my recent trip to Bohol, which I shared on Instagram and [[uman 2023-09|last month\u0026rsquo;s issue of Uman]], were edited in Darktable.\nWalking Baguio #I went back home to Pangasinan. I try to visit my family (that includes my dogs) every four months for around a couple of weeks. On this return, I also visited my sister and her kids in Baguio.\nOn October 15, a Sunday, I spent the morning walking from Engineer\u0026rsquo;s Hill to Magsaysay Ave. in search of a Middle-Eastern restaurant. Alas I came too early; the beef won\u0026rsquo;t be ready until lunch time. To kill time, I continued walking to the Bell Church that demarcates the border between Baguio City and La Trinidad.\nWhile walking towards the Taoist temple carelessly called a \u0026ldquo;Church,\u0026rdquo; I passed by a restaurant that held memories. I have never been in this restaurant but my friends in the church and I used to kid about this particular place. It was one of the fanciest restaurants in Baguio ten years ago (perhaps it still is?) and we joked that one day we would treat each other there—one day, we would always say. For this very reason, we find the name of the restaurant particularly appropriate: \u0026ldquo;Future Diner.\u0026rdquo;\nI am yet to eat at Future Diner.\nAt Bell Church I sat on a chair while watching exhausted students practice their dragon dance under a scorching sun. I raised my head periodically from the book I was reading on my phone to watch their progress. I did this for half an hour before deciding to return to the Middle-Eastern restaurant.\nOn my way back, I stopped at an intersection to let cars pass before I cross. A woman sitting at the back of a car looked at me eye to eye as the car passed in front of me. I think I knew this woman. I think I knew her very well.\nSuddenly, more memories of those three short but filled years in Baguio came rushing inside my head. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t be here any longer. I can\u0026rsquo;t be here any longer,\u0026rdquo; I told myself as I walked briskly.\nFor these reasons, that particular walk and my entire stay in Baguio was emotionally difficult and I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect it. More than ten years after I left the church without saying goodbye to any of the friends and family I made there, I still grieve this loss: a loss that I may have only started to confront head-on last year through [[a never-ending walk|the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo]].\nAlthough it will be a difficult project, I still want to re-walk all the routes I once walked in Baguio and La Trinidad to finally confront the memories I have there.\nFree Religion #After leaving Baguio, I finally accepted that I could no longer go through this long postponed grieving process alone. I needed help.\nI wrote an email to [[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown]], a UK-based Unitarian minister whose work is the closest thing to \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; that I truly resonate with since leaving the church. Andrew is an atheist and yet a proponent of [[jiyu shukyo|Free Religion (自由宗教 — jiyū shūkyō)]], a liberal and creative approach to spirituality and religiosity encouraged by [[shinichiro imaoka|Shin’ichirō Imaoka (1881-1988)]]. As I currently understand it, based on Imaoka\u0026rsquo;s Creed of Life, Free Religion\u0026rsquo;s aim is to deeply liberate us from our external identities, which includes the stringent rules of traditional religion, to connect us with our true selves doing so in the context of a deep reverence to our interdependence with the rest of humanity and the world.\nThe minister generously returned my email and gave me advice on how to begin embracing a free and creative religious existence. Back in Los Baños, I wrote the following note to myself which integrates everything I learned from my October trip.\nToday I return to LB. Grieving. Still grieving. Perhaps with a lot of internal work to do ahead. To remind myself that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t just letting life pass by me in the past 12 years. But that I was actually growing. Becoming.\nI am indeed feeling depression. But I do not despair. The depression is telling me that I could do something about it. It is not the case that I didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything in the past 12 years. The thing is that everyday is a new walk. And in the wilderness, change is the norm. There were friendships, communities I\u0026rsquo;ve been a part of. But the cost of freedom is that these communities are never tight. Whether I eventually become a part of a more stable \u0026ldquo;church\u0026rdquo; or not, I know what it feels like to be in the wilderness. And I know that it is possible to sustain oneself there. And whenever I feel that being part of a church is the next best thing for me to do, I know that I will cherish this experience with all my heart. It will be more worth it.\nRem #This month, my friends and Rem Tananuan\u0026rsquo;s family remembered him one year after his departure. [[rewalking rem tanauan|I wrote extensively last year about this event]], which I consider one of the greatest losses of my life. Rem was and still is the best friend I have ever had and his influence on my work, particularly on my poetry, my views on writing, and my spirituality is strong. He is in every poem I write, perhaps even in this essay.\nWith a few friends, we visited his mother and family at their house at Batangas on a day spent chatting, sharing food, playing video games, and communing with his library.\nLong before he left, Rem told his brother to homeschool Jai, his son. Jai has exhibited exceptional gifts that are way advance of his age. On the day of our visit, Jai sat on his uncle\u0026rsquo;s chair coloring scribbles of planets he drew.\nI remembered Rem.\nBooks #On October, I finished reading [[refusing heaven gilbert|Refusing Heaven by Jack Gilbert]], which I enjoyed.\nI started reading [[the existentialists survival guide marino|The Existentialist\u0026rsquo;s Survival Guide by Marino]] and [[bluets nelson|Bluets by Nelson]].\nIn the morning, I read and savor one meditation from [[being home norris and sibley|Being Home by Norris and Sibley]], a book I borrowed from Rem\u0026rsquo;s library.\n","date":"2 November 2023","permalink":"/uman/012/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 012 — October 2023"},{"content":" Uman means “change.” It is a monthly newsletter I send every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.

Read the past issue here.\nFaith and Contentment #The timer I use during meditation checks up on my mood before every practice. It does so by offering several choices. I never clicked the word \u0026ldquo;content.\u0026rdquo; I reason that I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of fixing a lot of things in my life, so how can I be contented?\nBut then I encountered the following excerpt from the essay \u0026ldquo;Presence, Memory, and Faith\u0026rdquo; by Steven E. Webb from Wilderness and the Heart, a book about [[henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s]] philosophy.\nFishing stands for the life of faith, and the leaping fish stands for those exclamatory experiences—perceptual, mnemonic, or both—that may supervene upon that life. Apart from our active commitment to what the river may bestow, we would never cast our lines and the fish would never leap. This does not mean that the fish must leap. We can\u0026rsquo;t control their presence, and if we seek for control we shall reduce our lives to continual frustration. Faith, like fishing, has the somewhat oxymoronic character of active waiting—of keeping oneself open to whatever may come. Thus wanting a saving experience at the end of one\u0026rsquo;s days not only indicates an unwholesome fixation on something one can\u0026rsquo;t finally possess, but is quite beside the point. The issue is not the availability or durability of such experiences as isolated moments, but rather what they confirm, if and when they do occur, about the \u0026ldquo;omnirelevant truth\u0026rdquo;—affirmed and kept in faith—that our world is a holy place, that things are worthy of love, and that our life together with them is affirmable even in our moments of obscurity, and even as we perish.\nReflecting on these words while walking one night at Ela Ave. in September, I realized that I could find contentment in every moment regardless of the situation and despite things being not okay. I could do this through faith, a word I\u0026rsquo;ve avoided ever since [[a never-ending walk|leaving my childhood religion]], but now I\u0026rsquo;m exploring and reintegrating into my life through my interpretation.\nDream Log #In response to my reading of [[a religion of ones own by moore|A Religion of One\u0026rsquo;s Own by Thomas Moore]], I started a [[dream log|dream log]]. I am still trying to figure out what good this practice will bring me, but I\u0026rsquo;m doing it out of curiosity. I noticed that starting a dream log seems to make me have more dreams and remember them. I haven\u0026rsquo;t caught all my dreams yet, and I might be slowly shedding this practice, but oh well. I am just trying.\nMind Walks #My favorite thought note this month is: [[art is never finished|Art is never finished]]. I wrote this while working on an essay I later sent to a literary journal. It talks about this modern bias to complete a work of art and why this could be going against the very nature of art.\nThe best quote I encountered in September is from Andrew Anabi:\nWhen life changes, you will probably miss the way it was. You may miss those long morning drives or walks to the office, or those hectic family gatherings. You may miss them because those moments are finite—you will only travel those streets and see those people a certain amount of times.\nEvery time you do something that is one less time you do it. One day you will do something the final time and you will rarely know when that day comes.\nFor all you know, today might be the last time you walk in a particular neighborhood. Or it might be the last time you smile at a particular someone. To think otherwise, would be foolish. Nothing is guaranteed, except this moment. Your only real choice is to cherish every exchange like it is your last \u0026ndash; because it very well might be.\nTherefore, the best way to cherish life is to remind yourself of life\u0026rsquo;s impermanence. It is to remember that every time you see someone that is one less time you see them. It is to remember that every time you go somewhere that is one less time you visit. By doing this, you naturally slow down. Almost like a reflex, you start to truly live.\nThe best things I read this month were:\n[[lynda barry kios|Lynda Barry Will Make You Believe in Yourself by Dan Kios]] [[nightingalingale mod|The Nightingalingale Newsletter by Craig Mod]] Newsletters #I published three newsletters in September:\n[[this morning|This Morning]] [[the possibility of love|The Possibility of Love]] [[sabel|Sabel]] Writing Events Applications #Last August, I wrote [[mulimuli pangasiniani|a lyric essay]] in Pangasinan and its [[perturbations on pangasiniani|English translation]] and sent it for my application to the Cordillera Creative Writing Workshop (CCWW). The rejection of my application got me thinking a lot about how I\u0026rsquo;m approaching these applications and my writing life. I\u0026rsquo;ll write a more detailed essay about this, but here\u0026rsquo;s my new personal guiding principle when sending entries to workshops, fellowships, and contests.\nSince the acceptance rate to these writing events is pretty low (which means I was just fortunate to get in [[anww20|ANWW20]]!), the healthiest attitude when applying is to expect rejection. Then, use the application process to these events to force you to do your work. Remember that this is the assumption of most of these events anyway—that you are bringing a work in progress. So do that.\nWhether you get in or not (highly likely you won\u0026rsquo;t), you were able to move a personal project. Everything should be about your personal projects. Articulate what your art stands for, focus on creating a portfolio around that stand, and never rely on others to tell you you\u0026rsquo;re good or publishable. Stick to your gut feeling and use contests, workshops, and fellowships to serve your vision, not the other way around.\nI used this newfound perspective in approaching the submission process to the Gawad Bienvenido Lumbera (GBL), a literary contest that recently ended its acceptance period.\nI sent a collection of my best 12 poems in Pangasinan. I began the project with the assumption that I would lose. Then, I used the application processes to force me to do work and teach myself writing. For this contest, it was about learning poetry, particularly revising it. To prepare for my entry, I chose the best Pangasinan anlong (poems) in my [[my forest garden of the mind|Talahardin]]. I started with seven, the minimum number set by the contest guidelines, but later added five more when I accidentally discovered the collection theme. I called the collection Kasabi Kaagwan or When Noon Comes, thus the number 12. After selecting the poems, I created a [[poem revision process|poem revision process]] based on [[billy collins masterclass|Billy Collins\u0026rsquo; Masterclass]] and used it to improve each poem in the collection.\nLike I said, I am pretty sure I won\u0026rsquo;t win any awards, but I have 12 poems that are now way better than when I first wrote them (way, way better!). Plus, my revision skills are now sharper. These two rewards for me are enough.\nSeptember was jam-packed with writing projects. Aside from the GBL and writing revisions for a client, I also worked on an essay that forced me to articulate my entire writing system and practice for the first time. It was a fun essay that braids walking and my note-writing system and their implications for literature in general. Again, I expect to be rejected\u0026hellip; but writing that essay has convinced me I might be able to teach my writing system to others soon. If the article gets accepted, you\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to know.\nBohol #Around the middle of the month, my partner and I visited Bohol. To be honest, I find it difficult for me to write about Bohol. Among all the provinces I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in the Philippines, this was the most commercialized, and I felt distrustful of people the whole time. That said, the trip helped me get back to photography, a practice I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to nurture in the past months. I still seek the right angle and story to share about the Bohol trip. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ll let some photos tell their story.\n","date":"3 October 2023","permalink":"/uman/011/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 011 — September 2023"},{"content":" Uman means “change.” It is a monthly newsletter I send every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.

But I\u0026rsquo;ve integrated it into The Long Walk.\nIn August, in between wrapping up a web design project with a client and starting a research writing project for a returning client, I managed to do some writing and studying.\nHere are my favorite adventures in writing, philosophy, and contemplation in August.\nJack Gilbert\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Existential\u0026rdquo; Poetry #After reading Isang Taong Maghapon by Paolo Tiausas, I realized I wanted to get back to my study of existentialism. So, I decided to look for an existentialist poetry book. Someone on Reddit suggested Jack Gilbert\u0026rsquo;s Refusing Heaven. I was surprised to learn that the first poem in this collection, \u0026ldquo;A Brief for the Defense,\u0026rdquo; was actually a poem I read years back, which I really loved for these lines:\nWe must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world. To make injustice the only measure of our attention is to praise the Devil.\nPublic Life and Mindfulness #I enjoyed writing two notes: one about public life and another about mindfulness. Here are some excerpts from each:\n[[public life is necessary|Public life is necessary]]\nI often value being in private, solitary, far from people. But without contact, relationships are impossible. No matter what political stand we hold, the truth is that we are stuck to each other. And being stuck in a nation, being stuck in this space and place, means I need to be with others. And there is a better way of being with others, which is really being around them, really understanding them.\n[[mindfulness over analysis|Mindfulness over analysis]]\nWe need more mindfulness in everyday life. Analysis is for special occasions or special lines of work. In our peak experiences, which are moments of strong emotions, we don\u0026rsquo;t analyze. Instead, we yield to the situation and moment. We allow ourselves to be moved.\nNewsletters #I managed to publish three newsletter issues:\n[[the very first memory|The Very First Memory]] [[lolo aldo|Lolo Aldo]] [[in july|In July]] Lyric Essays #This August, I decided to apply to a regional writer\u0026rsquo;s workshop that accepted works in my native Pangasinan language. At first, I thought I should send some Pangasinan poems (anlong), so I finished Billy Collins\u0026rsquo; Masterclass, which I thought should help me revise the poems better. But after finishing the course, I came to a realization: I wanted to focus on writing lyric essays. This is a genre of writing that I have been doing for the past two years long before I\u0026rsquo;ve ever discovered the term, and although I love reading and writing poetry, I wanted to stay closer to something that was true to me and get better at it. Plus, the book about walking in Los Baños, which I am currently working on will be a book of lyric essays. Might as well practice now.\nWhat resulted was [[mulimuli pangasiniani|Mulimuli Pangasiniani]], which I translated into English as [[perturbations on pangasiniani|Perturbations on Pangasiniani]]. It is a lyric essay about my personal struggles in writing in my mother tongue.\nWhile working on this essay, I read the works of other lyric essayists. A book that was particularly helpful was the anthology A Harp in the Stars edited by R. B. Noble.\nEpistolary Essays on Walking #I\u0026rsquo;ve always been a lone wolf and I\u0026rsquo;ve resisted collaborations. Although I\u0026rsquo;ve struggled with this in the past, I now treat this with acceptance and I intentionally do most of my work alone in recognition of my limits and what truly brings joy to me.\nThat said, I don\u0026rsquo;t mind the occasional collaboration especially when the project is right and I\u0026rsquo;m doing it with the right people.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently doing a collaborative writing project with a co-fellow at the Ateneo National Writer\u0026rsquo;s Workshop: Jesa Suganob. I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of Jesa\u0026rsquo;s work and we connected well during the workshop because our works both involved walking.\nOur project involves doing a series of walks from August to the end of September. We\u0026rsquo;re free to choose on which days to do the walking as long as we use each walk as a prompt for writing an epistolary essay on that walk. The essay is directed towards each other, but we won\u0026rsquo;t send the essays until the end of the project.\nI\u0026rsquo;m so excited to read Jesa\u0026rsquo;s essays. First, she lives in Mindanao, a place I\u0026rsquo;ve only visited less than the fingers in one hand. Second, Jesa brings a female perspective on walking, one which will only enrich my understanding of it. Lastly, Jesa writes in a style that is new to me. Although we\u0026rsquo;re both exploring lyric essays, she approaches this with ambiguity, which compelled me to recognize that I\u0026rsquo;ve actually been searching for clarity all my life.\nJesa has been sharing snippets of her part over at her blog (which I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying hard to avoid looking at!). But her introduction to the project is really beautiful, so I\u0026rsquo;m sharing it here: Suburban Loneliness: On Walking.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see where this project will bring us.\nCha Domingo\u0026rsquo;s Salu-salo #Meanwhile, my friend Patricia Domingo (@promdikusinera) recently launched a newsletter about her adventures as a Filipina chef. She called it Salu-salo, which means gathering, celebration, or feast. Cha is an earnest and uplifting writer and I really enjoyed her first issue (\u0026ldquo;Pause and Play\u0026rdquo;) where she talks about adobo, rest, and self-directed learning. She also described the [[nasa labas ang ili|Nasa Labas ang Ili]] meditative walks I facilitated at UPLB last April.\nHere is how she described here experience during the walk:\nIn April I joined a meditational walk as part of the Ilihan workshop series. The program guided by Vince Imbat gave me an entirely different perspective on the concept of pausing. I’m very fond of walking, it’s a way for me to turn inward and make sense of my mind. Whenever I’m struggling with difficult thoughts, I walk directionless with no agenda until I come to a solution or tire myself enough to head back home. I have done so since I was a teenager. Walking is such an automatic task (which is why I love it) that I rarely give any thought or care into the process. My brain is noisy, I just go. If I get tired, I’ll sit wherever I find myself.\nOur trek across UPLB grounds was organized into parts so that we could focus on three key aspects: kapwa (neighbor), pook (place), and sarili (self). The brief was simple, Vince said that prompts would be given along the way and that excited me. In the second part of our walk, we arrived at a field and it was revealed that this time would be used to rest “however that feels like to you.” We sat on the grass, some laid down and took naps, and others took photos. I idled in awkwardness thinking but I’m not tired yet!\nThis is how I came to the realization that I never anticipate or plan for rest in any aspect of my life. As a chef, I was conditioned to operate on the perfectionist premise of leaving no task unfinished. In the kitchen we do as much prep as we can to be able to clock out earlier. The signifier for me to take a break was that I felt tired, and even while on break I couldn’t allow myself to relax because I was preoccupied with the same task I had just stepped away from.\nThe way that Vince structured our program helped me unlock a new application for rest; how the mere addition of a purposeful break can add depth to any experience. It seems like a shallow observation but often times we’re too caught up in our routines and rely solely on instinct to tell us when to pause. I now understand that tiredness is an indication that I’ve already surpassed my capacity, which is never a good state to foster anything meaningful.\nWebsite Improvement #Lastly, I was also able to update this website, which currently runs on a free open-source markdown publishing technology called Quartz, to the latest version (v4). I experienced a major hiccup along the way, which involved my website being down for more than an hour and me having to rebuild it from scratch.\nMajor lessons:\nUpdate only when necessary. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to fix what isn\u0026rsquo;t broken. Introduce changes conservatively, slowly, intermittently, and carefully. Of course, these lessons are highly transferrable to almost everything in life.\n","date":"2 September 2023","permalink":"/uman/010/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 010 — August 2023"},{"content":"Walking back from buying\nmeat and vegetables for lunch\nthis morning at Data Street,\nI shut the umbrella close\nas a thick cloud covers the sun\npassing by breezily above us,\nabove the tiny store\nunder a fertile rambutan,\nwhere old women whose children\nhave all but flown away,\nnest alongside each other\nrecounting better days,\nwhile a middle-aged man\non a bicycle arrives\nasking whether tomatoes\nhave dropped in price,\nall of which transpires\nas the cloud finally\nreaches Makiling\u0026rsquo;s highest peak\non the backdrop where it shall stay\nhovering a little while longer\nthis morning.\n","date":"25 August 2023","permalink":"/tlw/022/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"This Morning"},{"content":"Yesterday, as I was walking back from sampling more of the IPB road, realizing it was difficult to walk on it, I saw this crowd of children and other groups sitting on the side of the road over the short concrete wall that UPLB built around its fields along Pili Drive. A taller adolescent, whom I recognized, joined the group of children. He was one of the fishball vendors at Grove, which I used to frequent in the afternoon before or after my walks. This young man has a crooked pinky finger, which he tries to hide sometimes. He was often shy, especially around female peers. But today, I saw him laughing, toying around the kids. He recognized me and was the first to nod his head to greet me. I nodded back. I walked pass them alongside two elderly ladies walking, taking their time.\nOn the fields, I saw that a group of boys had entered the concrete wall and were walking on that wide grassy dirt road that tractors use. The boys were exploring the fields, something I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to do. I remember Sta. Maria. I stopped beside the gate to the walkway and sat there.\nFor the longest time, I\u0026rsquo;ve withdrawn from crowds. Earlier on this walk, I even wrote on my phone: \u0026ldquo;Philippine society is too noisy both in person and online that you need to tear yourself from it to hear yourself.\u0026rdquo; But in the morning, I listened to [[steve patterson|Steve Patterson]]\u0026rsquo;s reading of an article he released this year on [[thoughts/platonism|platonism]]. I was meditating on it while walking, jotting down notes about how [[thoughts/relationship|relationships]] are abstract phenomena instantiated by human [[action|action]] to be near objects and humans. As the sound of children playing, enjoying this dry afternoon in July, filled my background, I suddenly found an affinity with the public. I may not always enjoy them, but I belong with them by being near them.\nConstant contact makes relationships inevitable, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t escape this. My relationship with myself and the place can only go as far as my relationship with the public allows. My method is walking, ideally in nature. But without participating in public affairs, I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to influence how we could protect nature and walking. Suddenly, I am considering my relationship with others—with society, the crowd of strangers I walk with daily, or the nameless faces I share spaces with. And, for the first time in a long time, I considered the possibility of love.\n","date":"20 August 2023","permalink":"/tlw/021/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"The Possibility of Love"},{"content":"He said he puts things where he remembers them.

After laying my backpack under the shade, I leaned on the tree and grabbed my phone from my right pocket. I looked at the time: it was already 10:37. I couldn’t believe I had been walking for two and a half hours with a backpack that weighed more than ten kilos.\nI turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. It peered behind thick foliage as if watching, even mocking me. It was there when the questions came to me: “Why am I doing this? Why am I walking?”\nOn June 9, 2022, I walked over 22 kilometers from my apartment at Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna. The walk that took 35,000 steps to complete in more than 5 hours started along the busy Lopez Avenue at Los Baños and traversed 5 kilometers of the Manila South Road, passing by the town of Bay, before turning right toward Calauan for another 5 kilometers. From Calauan, the walk turned into a 10-kilometer hike on a highway with a 630 feet elevation en route to San Pablo City.\nThe following morning, I walked an extra 22,000 steps around Sampaloc Lake and visited nearby Bunot Lake. I went home that afternoon by riding a jeep that covered what I had walked for five hours the day before in just around 30 minutes. Riding that jeep home was surreal.\nDays after the walk, the questions that came to me while staring at Mt. Banahaw continued to revisit me. Why was I walking? I have walked almost my entire life but never questioned my motivations until the long walk to San Pablo City.\nAt first, I struggled to piece together a coherent answer. I was surprised that thinking about my reason for walking reminded me of supposedly unrelated existential issues concerning my past. My journals slowly revealed that walking had become my way to traverse the distance between two identities—that liminal space between my Old Self and my New Self.\nThe Limen #I first learned about the concept of liminality from the book Les Rites de Passage (1909) by Arnold van Gennep. In that book, he introduced a three-phased structure of rites of passage followed by people from different cultures: separation, transition, and reincorporation. Liminality corresponds with the second phase: transition. For Gennep, the transition was always deliberate and voluntary.\nWhen we launch ourselves into liminality, we transcend our former identities. Liminality is likened to death, being in utero, and the wilderness. When separated from our former identities, we enter a vast existential expanse, the limen, where our sense of being forsaken becomes even more pronounced. An identity blackhole engulfs us, but we are unaware of it.\nI was raised in a family of devout Jehovah’s Witnesses, where the Bible was the central authority from which all behaviors were measured. Everything, from big decisions like when to enter a romantic relationship, when and to whom could we have sex, or whether to go to college or not, to minor decisions like what clothes or hairstyles to wear, was dictated to us by a Governing Body made of nine American men located in Brooklyn, New York—all white except one—who delivered instructions on living through a sophisticated chain of command.\nI didn’t fully embrace the faith of my parents until I, despite the discouragement of members of our local congregation in San Jacinto, Pangasinan, and threats of my father’s removal from his pastoral duties, went to college at Baguio City. There, I met other young Jehovah’s Witnesses passionately pursuing religious responsibilities amid college life. They inspired me to look deeper at the faith of my parents and accept it as my own. In three years, I dedicated my life to the faith, ultimately becoming a ministerial servant of the Jehovah’s Witnesses—a young pastor—at 19 while serving in a congregation that catered to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through sign language.\nAt the end of my first semester in the third year, the life ahead of me was crystal clear. I belonged to a tight-knit community. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to think much about what to believe because everything was spoon-fed. I knew who I was and what I wanted to become: a missionary who would bring the doctrines of the religion into distant places. I found my purpose.\nBut all of these began crumbling down on March 11, 2011.\nThe Long Cold #05:30 A.M.\nThe sound of my phone’s alarm woke me up.\nFor a brief moment, I wanted to ignore it and go back to sleep, but I didn’t. I was building a new habit and knew missing two days in a row was terrible. I couldn’t do it yesterday because I slept at Kuya Al and Ate Sarah’s place. She was there too.\nI wanted to start caring more for my body, so I had to do this. But I regret not returning to sleep. I should’ve returned.\nThere was nothing unusual with this morning. I stood up and switched the lights on, illuminating the windowless room that was pitch dark a second ago. My notebook, the daily devotional, and the Bible all piled together gleamed on top of the Monobloc I used as a table whenever I sat on my bed.\nI kept the pants I wore when I slept and just put on my blue sweater. It was one of those sweaters with a zipper that ran only from the neck to the chest. It had no pockets, and it was collared like a polo shirt.\nI walked out of the room and closed the door. My sister was still sleeping in the room across the dining table and the vacant space that was supposed to be the living room.\nBehind the curtains, tiny white and yellow lights flickered. They were from the fields that grew flowers over the hills of Ambiong, the only lights visible outside aside from the few street lights here and there. The sun won’t show up until about another 30 minutes.\nAfter putting on my rubber shoes, I unlocked the wooden door and the steel and screened door behind it. I didn’t know it back then, but those two doors separated me from what will be an entirely different life.\nOutside, I felt the air change as I walked the steep eskinita that led to the main road. From afar, I could hear that the main road was empty and silent, except for one or two jeepneys already starting their day. Upon reaching the street, the path began to go downhill. I walked, crossed the road, and stood in front of the opened gate of the enclosed hill called Bayan Park.\nI climbed the hill and started jogging. I was alone. The air was still cold. A few weeks from now, Baguio’s temperature will start rising. But today, the cold that filled all our Decembers was still here: it was difficult to break a sweat.\nAfter just a few minutes of jogging, I stopped.\nI should feel good, but I didn’t.\nI started walking.\nI can still hear her words. I can still hear my words. I can still feel the pain of realizing how young I was and how vulnerable to the weaknesses of the soul. I wasn’t aware until then that I was in my head the entire time. I knew I should be sad, and I thought I was miserable. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t know then that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t sadness that I was starting to feel.\nIt was something more: something that would last for weeks, months, years.\nThe only thing I knew then was that it was unusually dark. The sun wasn’t around. It won’t come out until about 30 more minutes. And it was cold. Too cold. The beginning of a long, long cold.\nLeaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses #On March 11, 2011, a couple of weeks before the end of my sixth semester in college, I started developing symptoms of clinical depression. I was forced to file for a leave of absence at my university to rest for an entire year back home in Pangasinan.\nRecovering from depression was the most challenging thing I ever went through. I saw a psychiatrist when the symptoms were already at their peak—severe insomnia, severe chronic fatigue, anxiety attacks almost every five minutes, and frequent suicidal ideations. Since I found help late, I also began medication late. Psychiatric meds don’t immediately kick in, so I had to endure the symptoms for another month before finding relief.\nWhat happens to a devoutly religious young man who suddenly finds himself in the bottomless pit of depression? First, he asks whether God has forsaken him. Then he turns toward the church he belongs to and questions whether what they tell him about God is even true in the first place.\nMonths after pharmacotherapy, my sleeping patterns became normal again. The anxiety attacks stopped, and the suicidal ideations lessened. I was still tired most of the time, and an unrelenting dark cloud followed me wherever I went. But I have found some equilibrium. This equilibrium allowed me to continue questioning the foundations of my religious upbringing, including whether there is a God and if the religion where I belonged was indeed his church. This questioning lasted for months culminating in my decision to leave the Jehovah’s Witnesses in April 2012.\nI still remember that afternoon when I made the decision. My father, mother, and sisters were preparing to attend the memorial of Christ’s death, the only religious celebration the Jehovah’s Witnesses observe every year.\nI stayed inside my room and refused to come out. When my family had left, I took my pen and notebook, placed them inside my backpack, and rode my bike to a nearby abandoned street. There, I saw a mango tree behind a small kubo. I sat under the tree and wrote my heart out in the pages of my journal. I wrote until the sun set it. That evening, I rode my bike home on an empty road illuminated by a full moon.\nAt that time, I was following what felt right. Little did I know that leaving a religion and a way of life I spent the first 20 years of my life in would be like wandering in an existential wilderness. Abandoning my faith was abandoning myself, and this launched me right into a messy liminal state, where identities are never yet final, and I was always becoming someone I didn’t yet know.\nA Religious Wilderness #After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2012, I went through a two-year exploration of atheism and humanism. Although I never really connected with the atheist community, I explored its most radical forms. I started by reading books like Bondage of the Mind (2008) by R. D. Gold and The Bible as History (2008) by Werner Keller. These books convinced me to reject that the Bible is the inspired word of God. After this, I began questioning the very existence of a God.\nConvinced that the existence of a personal God wasn’t necessary, I continued living my life and discovered that it was possible to be happy and find meaning despite being “godless.” Around this time, I encountered Eastern philosophy. I read the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and the Tao Te Ching. I listened to New Age gurus, learned yoga, and practiced meditation.\nImmersing in Eastern philosophy helped me realize that although the nonexistence of a God appeals to me, I didn’t resonate with the hatred that radical atheists felt towards religion. I understood it wasn’t necessary or possible to eradicate such an ingrained element of human culture. Despite not identifying with organized religion or spiritual groups, I realized I was still profoundly “spiritual.” I sought to answer the deep questions of existence and reality.\nIn search of answers, I went around different spiritual traditions. I sat down with a sangha of Zen Buddhists in Baguio City, I meditated with Theravada Buddhists in Marikina, I listened to the talks of an Advaita Vedanta teacher on Facebook, and I spent an entire day with a Dada of Ananda Marga.\nI tried hard to find something, anything, that would stick but soon discovered that while I appreciated the experimental nature of Eastern philosophy and spirituality, where I am allowed to be in other groups simultaneously, I was not too fond of the intellectual animosity among many of them and sometimes a complete rejection of the rational.\nAfter two years of moving around Eastern spiritual circles, I fell in love with philosophy, which reconnected me to my rational, intellectual self. I read heavily on metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, walking every afternoon to reflect on the things I was learning. The main question I asked in my philosophical studies was, \u0026ldquo;How should I live?\u0026rdquo; I resolved that if I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a new religion to belong to, I would build my worldview from the ground up and set my own rules for living.\nToday, I accept that I am in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state. Here, I go back and forth between the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming—that unrefined current identity that hasn’t fully reached reincorporation for it to be called my New Self.\nI am not inclined to associate with any organized religion. I still don’t think a personal God is necessary, even if his or her existence won’t surprise me. I may have ceased to care too much about metaphysics altogether. But I am still profoundly spiritual and deeply religious, and my intellectual self counterbalances that. I resonate with the progressive and liberal Free Religion concept of Shin’ichirō Imaoka (1881–1988).\nDespite my religious identity (and my identity in general) being in flux for ten years since leaving my childhood religion, I never articulated this clearly. I knew I tended not to commit and was uncertain about many things since leaving the church, but I was unaware that my separation from my Old Self caused this uncertainty. I was in an interstitial identity blackhole but unaware of it.\nTo make matters worse, I avoided thinking about my life as a Jehovah’s Witness. I avoided it even in the safe pages of my journals. It was a dark past that needed to be completely buried.\nBy enacting my liminality through daily walking, culminating in the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo City, things began to change.\nWalking Liminality #My desire to walk is a physical expression—a symptom—of being liminal. Walking is performed liminality. After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, I noticed I was growing an affinity with nature, landscapes, and physical spaces. It was as if my subconscious told me, “Since society has forsaken you, perhaps it is in the animate outdoors where you shall find a home.” For a long time, I believed that.\nWalking in nature became a way to recuperate from losing friends and family members who will no longer associate with someone who has “grown cold in faith.” I walked because I was largely unsure of where I was going and who I was. And this uncertainty calls for it to be performed, embodied, and enacted. My appreciation for long walks, or short daily walks, reflected this need to perform uncertainty through my body while at the same time hoping that perhaps through it, I could recreate myself.\nI return to the photographs I took during all the walks I have undertaken since leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I now see glimpses of what it means to be in limen. I didn’t know it then when I took the photos, but there was a reason why I was attracted to abandoned buildings, decaying objects, and landscapes that evoked uncertainty and limbo.\nI read that ethnographers find themselves in a similar liminal state when conducting fieldwork in a foreign culture for the first time. As they attempt to temporarily abandon their own culture and immerse themselves into the culture of their study, ethnographers discover that their participants don’t immediately trust them. Moreover, being stuck with their participants in geographic space heightens the ethnographers\u0026rsquo; sense of unbelonging. Some ethnographers report breaking free from this liminal state by walking with their participants.\nThere is something with walking, this simple tool of mobility, that helps humans traverse liminality. Two of walking’s most critical features are encounter and relationality. When walking, an ethnographer encounters two entities: the participant and the place where they are walking. Before the walk, the ethnographer may have very little in common with the participant. However, as the ethnographer joins the participant in traversing place and experience, a commonality emerges between them. This commonality lays the foundation for deeper connection and, therefore, more honest revelations.\nWalking opens the space for informality and honesty between the researcher and the researched. Because walks are informal, they allow moments of experimental encounter. Freed from strict rules of research, both ethnographer and participant speak freely to each other. The freedom walking provides facilitates the negotiation of identities between two contrasting people.\nI wonder whether this could explain my unquenchable desire to walk throughout all those years after leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses.\nMeeting My Old Self on the Road #Whenever I walk alone, I walk with two people: my Old Self and my New Self Becoming. Walking generates a moment from within the identity threshold where these two meet face-to-face, no matter how short. What often comes from this encounter is honest reflection.\nLike an ethnographer, I could use walking to find my Old Self waiting for me on the proverbial road and invite him to walk with me, hoping to build trust with each other enough to unveil the distance that has separated us for years and find ways to walk that distance together.\nThis encounter with my Old Self happened on that elevated stretch after leaving Calauan—a geographic threshold between Los Baños and San Pablo City. Of the many questions that walking on that threshold provoked, one that stood out was about my motivations for walking. In hindsight, the very nature of walking—the informality, the freedom, the physicality, and the embodied and deeply reflexive nature of the experience—opened the gates and made me finally confront my Old Self.\nBefore the long walk to San Pablo, I avoided revisiting my past as a Jehovah’s Witness. I used to think of those first 20 years of my life as a dark, wasted time, with nothing to contribute to where I am now other than as a reference point to whom I shouldn’t become. However, after the long walk, my journal entries suggested that I was interested in inquiring about how my past could inform my current work.\nIn my journal, I began comparing my current life with my past life and was surprised to realize that several elements of my old religious life were better than what I have now. Back then, I was embedded in a community. I worked hands-on with a historically marginalized group (the Deaf) and immediately saw that my work made a difference in other people’s lives. I don’t have these things now, but I want them again. Although I will never achieve the clarity I had about who I was and what I wanted to do, I now see that there are elements in my former life that I want to reintegrate into my current life.\nInterestingly, my journal entries began discussing how my Old Self as a religious person still manifests in what I currently do. I started entertaining the idea that my work as a philosophically-inclined writer who walks may still have religious elements even if I categorize myself as an agnostic.\nIn my journal entry on August 29, 2022, more than two months after the long walk to San Pablo City, I wrote the following:\nToday, I will be trying to understand whether what I am doing is indeed religious. Obviously, it is philosophical, and like Bugbee, I don’t have to articulate it and call it “religion” or even associate myself with the field of religion or religious studies. All I need to know is whether I could find inspiration from this field that I have been practically avoiding since 2012.\nWalking is a religious thing. The great walkers I read, namely Henry David Thoreau and Henry Bugbee, all have works that can be described as religious. I use religion in its generous, liberal sense, a commitment to a way of life based on principles, regardless of where those principles come from. In the past, I heavily relied on an organization to dictate those principles. Today, I rely primarily on myself. But both new and old identities share a common desire to be religious, and I would never have realized this had I not walked from Los Baños to San Pablo City.\nWhat Walking Does to Us #What happened there on the walk? What made me talk to my Old Self that I have resisted, ignored, and intentionally distanced from for years? Under a scorching sun, with only an umbrella to protect me, forgetting to put on sunscreen or bring sunglasses, and burdened by the excessive luggage behind my back, an opportunity for irreverent dialogue with my Old Self was opened.\nThe physicality of walking prompted my New Self Becoming to loosen its guard, shatter the walls it built around itself, and finally confront what was always its subject of concern but unconsciously or consciously avoided: my Old Self. And what a productive move this was because my Old Self held knowledge of the terrain that my New Self Becoming doesn’t have.\nGoing through this process took work. I was frightened to realize that perhaps my New Self Becoming hadn’t yet moved that far away from my Old Self, that this new identity that I thought was new was still ancient, and that what I was trying to walk through metaphorically wasn’t an expanse but, in fact, an interstice.\nBut this is what walking does to the Self on the threshold of identities. It reveals commonalities between the past and present. It works as a form of transportation to help the Self traverse the liminal realm that links and separates two opposed identities. Walking allows one to relax and trust. Conversation with oneself is more natural than journaling at a desk, natural breaks are permitted, and visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection.\nWhile walking one afternoon, I noticed a long line of flowers in two colors. At first, I thought they grew from different plants: one flower being a variant of the other. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised that the flowers grew from the same plant, although different in color. I would later learn that these were Umbrella Worts or more commonly known as Four O’clocks, because they opened around that time, coinciding with my afternoon walks.\nThis visual drama triggered thoughts on community—one of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion. As a Jehovah’s Witness, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believed in almost daily. This sense of belonging was lost after I left. I have tried hard to find community, but I now accept that being in a liminal space means coming to peace with not being connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate them are now my norm.\nWalking and noticing Umbrella Worts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether growing a community despite differences is possible. This insight points me toward reincorporation.\nPerpetual Liminality or A Never-ending Walk #Leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses was painful. I abandoned a familiar life that gave me a sense of stability for a long time. I abandoned many friends, good people who have done many good things for me and treated me as their real brother. I abandoned my parents, who I know are still hopeful that one day I will return.\nI will return. I know I will but in a different way.\nI found that the possibility of return, of rebuilding myself, only begins when I recognize that I am in control of my destiny. Abandonment is painful, but it is also the autonomy of existence. Because no one is telling me what I need to do with my life, I have complete freedom to shape who I want to be and how I want to exist. From here lies the key to ending liminality and reaching the third phase of Van Gennep’s rite of passage: reincorporation.\nImplicit to the idea of liminality is that it has to end. I, who have lost my community and identity, must find a new community and identity. The correspondence between my Old Self and my New Self Becoming facilitated by the ambulatory inquiry that happens through walking, must now point me towards arriving at that ever-elusive ideal: my New Self.\nI have seen recent signs of reincorporation in my life. I walked on Session Road in Baguio City during my first visit in two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, and I remembered how I used to walk the same pavement holding an umbrella under drizzles while wearing a polo shirt, slacks, leather shoes, and a shoulder bag.\nI intuit that perhaps my unquenchable desire to walk and study walking came from all those years of walking as a minister of the Jehovah’s Witnesses visiting Deaf after Deaf scattered around the hills of Baguio City and La Trinidad. It may be a subconscious compromise to an activity I could no longer do as part of the religious community I left. Walking reincorporated itself into my new life, my new identity, which until now, I haven’t fully articulated.\nBut why should it be articulated? Liminality is not a single flavor. It could be either transitional or perpetual—a social position that persists in ambiguity and expansive in loyalty. In peripatetic language, a perpetual liminal state is a never-ending walk.\nThe Unitarian minister Andrew James Brown provided a phrase that allows me to describe what I need now as I traverse the road ahead: “the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today.” This is walking at its very essence.\nAs a metaphor for traversing liminality, walking reminds us that every day is a new walk. What only ends this daily recurring walk is the eventual perishing of the body. As long as it is here, the body, through movement, shall remind us of this perpetual liminality, this constant becoming, and helps us embrace it, traverse it, and perhaps even find ourselves at home en route to nowhere.\n","date":"15 July 2023","permalink":"/tlw/018/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"A Never-ending Walk"},{"content":"Abstract #Using a five-hour walk from Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna, as a springboard, this autoethnographic essay explores how I used the embodied, emplaced, and social act of walking as a means to traverse a psycho-socio-religious liminality. This essay reflects on my personal experience as an ex-ministerial servant (young pastor) of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, who left the religion after a personal crisis in 2012 and have spent ten years in an almost unconscious liminal state, characterized by exploring different belief systems and shifting between the yearning for the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming. Walking was a symptom of liminality and a way to perform this unconscious liminal state, which was only made conscious after the physicality of the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo City provoked me to inquire about my motivations for walking. Through reviewing journal entries I wrote after the long walk and reflecting on photographs I have taken in recent years, I conclude that the knowledge generated through walking and ambulatory inquiry could open correspondence between my previous identity and the new identity I am forming, providing the possibility of leaving the limen or, perhaps, finding a new home within it.\nMy shoulders tightened as I sensed a slight pain in my sacrum. As I took another step, I grabbed both of my backpack\u0026rsquo;s shoulder straps to pull them forward away from my chest. As I did this, I felt my bag’s soft but warm cushion on my back, and the pain in my shoulders subsided. On my left, two dump trucks moved like tortoises climbing a rock. Behind them, a long line of cars started to form. I did not expect this eight-mile stretch from Calauan to San Pablo City to be elevated—one of the many other things I miscalculated in this walk. This elevated artery, which reminded me of the Aspiras–Palispis Highway of Benguet, was the most challenging part of the walk, mainly because it had almost no shade and sidewalks. The sun was peaking, and it burned my legs and feet—feet that were in pain from blisters.\nA shadow formed before me as I continued walking toward a sharp curve. A small tree cast the shadow. After laying my backpack on the ground under the shade, I rested the left side of my body on the tree and grabbed my phone from my right pocket. I looked at the time. It was already 10:37 in the morning. I cannot believe I have been walking for two and a half hours with a backpack that probably weighed more than ten kilos. I turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. Mt. Banahaw peered behind thick foliage as if watching, even mocking me for the fool I made myself become. It was there when the questions came to me: “Why am I doing this? Why am I walking?”\nOn June 9, 2022, I walked over 22 kilometers from my apartment at Los Baños to San Pablo City, Laguna. The walk that took 35,000 steps to complete in more than 5 hours started along the busy Lopez Avenue at Los Baños and traversed 5 kilometers of the Manila South Road, passing by the town of Bay, before turning right toward Calauan for another 5 kilometers. From Calauan, the walk turned into a 10-kilometer hike on a highway with a 630 feet elevation en route to San Pablo City. The following morning, I walked an extra 22,000 steps around Sampaloc Lake and visited nearby Bunot Lake. I went home that afternoon by riding a jeep that covered what I had walked for five hours the day before in just around 30 minutes—a surreal experience.\nDays after the walk, I continued to revisit the questions that came to me while staring at Mt. Banahaw. Why was I walking? I have walked almost my entire life but never questioned my motivations until the long walk to San Pablo. At first, I struggled to piece together a coherent answer. I was surprised that thinking about my reason for walking directed me to supposedly unrelated existential issues concerning my past and current identities. After reviewing my journal entries, it became clear that walking has become my way to traverse the distance between identities—that liminal space between what I like to call my Old Self and my New Self and finally come face-to-face with my New Self Becoming.1\nA Liminal Wilderness #The concept of liminality emerged during the 20th century through works written in three disciplines: ethnography, architecture, and cultural anthropology. In all these disciplines, liminality was defined as an in-between state. Arnold van Gennep first used the word in the book Les Rites de Passage (1909) to describe the second phase of a three-phased structure of rites: separation, transition, and reincorporation. For Gennep, the transition was always deliberate and voluntary. An individual launches themself into a disoriented state of liminality to transcend their former identity. In the 1950s, the concept entered architecture through the work of Aldo van Eyck, who expressed human transcience through the geometry of circles and rectangles. The architecture of liminal spaces sought to combine being in space and being in time as individuals interact with geometrical parameters (Al Shrbaji 75).\nThe cultural anthropologist Victor Turner reintroduced liminality to anthropology in the 1960s, focusing on its psychosocial nature. For Turner, liminality is subjectively experienced and expressed by an individual. He likened it to death, being in utero, and the wilderness (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 95). He described it as “a realm that has few or none of the attributes of the past or coming state” (Turner “Betwixt and Between” 47). Separation from one’s old identity launches one into a vast existential expanse, the limen, where one’s existential “thrownness” (Dahistrom 12) becomes even more pronounced. Such experiences of being “neither here nor there” (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 94) slowly engulf us into an identity blackhole where we forget that we are inside one.\nI was raised in a family of devout Jehovah’s Witnesses, where the Bible was the central authority from which all behaviors were measured. Everything, from big decisions like when to enter a romantic relationship, when to engage in sexual activities, or whether to go to college or not, to more minor decisions like what clothes or hairstyles to wear, was dictated to us by a Governing Body made of nine American men located in Brooklyn, New York—all white except one—who delivered instructions on living through a sophisticated chain of command. I did not fully embrace the faith of my parents until I—despite the discouragement of members of our local congregation in San Jacinto, Pangasinan, and threats of my father’s removal from his elder duties—went to college at Baguio City, where I met other Jehovah’s Witnesses who were passionately pursuing religious responsibilities amid college life. In three years, I dedicated almost every waking hour of my life to the faith, ultimately becoming a ministerial servant—a young pastor—at 19 while serving in a congregation that catered to the Deaf and Hard of Hearing through sign language. I remember being at the end of my first semester in the third year, feeling intensely that the life ahead of me was so clear. I belonged to a tight-knit community. I did not have to think much about what to believe because everything was spoon-fed to me, and I knew who I was and what I wanted to become: a missionary, bringing the doctrines of the religion into distant places.\nAll of these began crumbling down on March 11, 2011, when I started developing symptoms of clinical depression. I was forced to file for a leave of absence at my university to spend an entire year back home recovering. Recovering from depression was the most challenging thing I ever went through. I saw a psychiatrist when the symptoms were already at their peak—insomnia, severe chronic fatigue, anxiety attacks almost every five minutes, and suicidal ideations—so I began medication late. To make matters worse, the meds did not immediately kick in. I had to endure the symptoms for over a month before finding relief. What happens to a devoutly religious young man in such circumstances is that he starts to question whether God has forsaken him. Then this thought leads to questioning whether what the community he belongs to tells him about God is correct.\nAfter finding equilibrium, I began questioning the foundations of my upbringing, including whether there is a God and if the religion where I belonged was indeed his church. This questioning culminated in my decision to leave my childhood religion in April 2012. At that time, I was following what felt right. Little did I know that leaving a religion and a way of life I spent the first 20 years was like death or being in an existential wilderness. Abandoning my religion was abandoning my Old Self, which launched me right into a messy psycho-socio-religious liminal state, where identities are never yet final, and I was always becoming someone I did not yet know who.\nThe state of liminality is characterized by flux, a state where identity shapeshifts, and nothing is final (Turner “Liminality and Communitas” 94–95). Individuals in a state of liminality tend to be more open to multiple ideas and meanings as they attempt to recreate themselves (Stenner 209). A period of liminality is filled with uncertainty (Stenner 239) and, in my experience, difficulty committing to almost anything. After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2012, I went through a two-year exploration of atheism. Although I never really connected with the atheist community, I explored its most radical forms. I started by reading books like Bondage of the Mind (2008) by R. D. Gold and The Bible as History (2008) by Werner Keller, which convinced me to reject that the Bible is the inspired word of God. Then I started questioning the very existence of a God.\nHowever, after a few years of reading about atheism and humanism, I encountered Eastern philosophy. I read the Bhagavad Gita, the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and the Tao Te Ching. I listened to New Age gurus, learned yoga, and practiced meditation. At this time, I realized that I did not resonate well with angry radical atheists who wanted to eradicate religion. Despite not identifying with organized religion or spiritual groups, I realized I was still profoundly “spiritual.” I went around different spiritual circles: Zen Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta, and Hinduism, finding something, anything, that would stick. While I appreciate the experimental nature of being in these spiritual circles, where I am allowed to be in other groups simultaneously, I also encountered intellectual animosity among many of them and sometimes a complete rejection of the rational. After two years around spiritual circles, I fell in love with philosophy, which reconnected me to my rational, intellectual self. Today, I accept that I am in some psycho-socio-religious liminal state. Here, I go back and forth between the structure of my Old Self and the anti-structure of my New Self Becoming (Stenner 266). I do not desire to associate with any organized religion or beliefs. I still do not think a personal God is necessary, even if his or her existence will not surprise me. I may have ceased to care too much about metaphysics altogether. However, I am still profoundly spiritual and deeply religious, and my intellectual self counterbalances that. Currently, I resonate with the progressive and liberal Free Religion concept of Shin’ichirō Imaoka (1881–1988).\nDespite my religious identity (and my identity in general) being in flux for ten years since leaving my childhood religion, I never articulated this clearly. I knew I tended not to commit and was uncertain about many things since leaving the church, but I was unaware that this uncertainty was caused by separating myself from my Old Self. I was in an interstitial identity blackhole but did not know I was in one. To make matters worse, I avoided thinking about my life as a Jehovah’s Witness. I avoided it even when writing in the safe blank pages of my journals. It was a dark past that needed to be completely buried. By enacting my psycho-socio-religious liminality through daily walking, culminating in the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, things began to change.\nWalking Liminality #My desire to walk is a physical expression—a symptom—of liminality. Walking is performed liminality (Stenner 257). One notices this in the works of walking writers like Craig Mod, who has connected his desire to walk Japan with his background as an adopted child and a foreigner in a country far from home. In issue 55 of his popular newsletter Ridgeline, Mod wrote, “I am adopted. The sensation of unbelonging—the tenuousness of connection without blood—permeates the life of an adopted person, and so perhaps having lived that allows me to feel a kind of comfort in the distance of life here” (“The Rigor of Process”). In issue 86, Mod continued, “Adopted, Japan based some twenty+ years, torn from a blue-collar shell east of Hartford. Drunkenly walked Tokyo at night in my teens and twenties, and now soberly walk the countryside of Japan in my thirties. Walks have come to define my days and years, are now a durable “platform.” Using them to deconstruct the human geography and history of Japan\u0026hellip;” (“Summer Walks”).\nMod’s attraction to mobility also coincides with his attraction to material culture, specifically architecture, photography, and food (“Kissa by Kissa” 20). As if abandoned by society, people in liminal states cling to the material world for refuge. After leaving the Jehovah’s Witnesses, I have always felt called by nature, landscapes, and physical spaces. It was as if my subconscious was telling me, “You do not belong to any social circle. Perhaps it is in the animate outdoors where you truly belong.” For a long time, I actually may have believed that.\nWalking in nature became a way to recuperate from losing friends and family members who will no longer associate with someone who has “grown cold in faith.” I walked because I was largely unsure of where I was going and who I was. Moreover, this uncertainty calls for it to be performed, embodied, and enacted. My appreciation for long walks, or short daily walks, reflected this need to perform uncertainty through my body (Yi’En 212) while at the same time hoping that perhaps through it, I could recreate myself.\nIf documentation through field notes and photography could capture our experience of liminality when looking at dereliction in geographic space, say, in abandoned urban spaces (Al Shrbaji 74), then perhaps, documentation too can be used to capture liminality as expressed through the field notes and photos we take during a walk. Photography and written or audio notes capture the memory of that specific moment in the threshold. I go back to the photographs I took during all the walks I have undertaken since leaving my childhood religion, and I now see glimpses of what it means to be in limen. I did not know it then when I took the photos, but there was a reason why I was attracted to abandoned buildings, decaying objects, and landscapes that evoke uncertainty and limbo.\nFigure 1.

Graffitied Abandoned House, Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan, 2022 Figure 5. Abandoned House, UPLB, Laguna, 2023 “Walking carries with it the possibility for the exploration of the liminal” (Hickey et al. 41). There is something with this simple tool of mobility that helps one traverse liminality. Two of the most critical features of walking are encounter and relationality. If we adopt Hickey et al.’s proposal that ethnographies should be “deeply relational encounters” (37), walking must be a quintessential ethnographic method. A model for how walking can be applied in ethnography may be extracted from the book Street Corner Society (1943), where the ethnographer William Foot-Whyte walked with his participants. Foot-Whyte, a pioneer of participant observation, noticed how the geographic space of the slum area he and his participants walked through, along with the meanings and cultural behaviors attached to specific parts of the area, dictated his research progress, i.e., the questions he could ask, the behaviors he could act out, and the identities he could or could not take hold.\nWhen walking, an ethnographer encounters two entities: the Other and the place where they are walking (Ingold and Vergunst 5). Before the walk, the ethnographer may have little commonality with the Other. However, as the walk happens and the ethnographer joins the Other in traversing place and experience, i.e., liminality, a commonality emerges between the researcher and the researched. This commonality lays the foundation for deeper connection and, therefore, more honest revelations. Through walking, ethnography becomes what it should always be: a “shared knowing, generated in place, together” (Hickey et al. 40). The knowledge that emerges out of this shared liminality facilitated by walking is characterized by ethnographers who have used walking methodologies as genuine, honest, new, and deeply relational—knowledge that is “necessarily peripatetic” (Hickey et al. 40).\nWe could point to several characteristics of walking that make it a perfect ethnographic method. First, walking opens the space for informality and candor between the researcher and the researched. While walking, the researcher and the researched are allowed to be “messy, uncertain, and multivoiced” (Denzin and Lincoln 26), which is not always the case in formal armchair interviews. Second, because walks are informal, they allow moments of “experimental encounter” (Hickey et al. 42). Freed from strict rules of research, both researcher and participant experience parrhesia (speaking freely). Last, and perhaps most importantly, the freedom that walking provides facilitates the negotiation of identities between the researcher and the researched as they traverse the inherently liminal nature of ethnographic research together (Hickey et al. 50). Walking, therefore, is both a tool and metaphor for ethnographic inquiry.\nWalking as Autoethnography #If walking not only figuratively explains the liminal nature of ethnographic research but also helps an ethnographer traverse this interstitial space, then the benefits of walking are easily transferrable to autoethnography. When applied to an autoethnographic encounter of someone in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, as I am, walking generates a moment from within that liminal state through a “physiologically mediated propulsion of the body and socially performed action” (Hickey et al. 48) and transforms it into a shared encounter between the Old Self and the New Self Becoming. The idea that the Old Self and the New Self Becoming are sharing this moment in the threshold becomes the very foundation from where more honest reflection could emerge.\nIn autoethnography, the researcher is also the participant. You (the ethnographer) research yourself (the participant) whose experiences and entire life reflect your identity, anchored on a social group (Ellis et al.). Autoethnography proposes that digging into your autobiography induces conclusions that could represent what occurs within your social group (Ellis et al.). However, what if, like I am, you are in a psycho-socio-religious liminal state where your identity and social group are undefined and in flux? In this circumstance, walking, through its very nature as a physiological, social, and emplaced act, unveils the liminal space and the distance between the former identity (the Old Self) and the new identity (the New Self Becoming).\nThis happened to me on that elevated stretch after leaving Calauan—a geographic threshold between Los Baños and San Pablo. Of the many perplexing questions that walking provoked, one that stood out was what triggered me to inquire about my motivations for walking. In hindsight, it was the very nature of walking—the informality, the freedom, the physicality, and the embodied and “deeply reflexive” nature of the experience (Hickey et al. 37)—that opened the gates and made me finally confront my Old Self. The cognitive and sensorial nature of walking makes it a powerful ethnographic method (Ingold 17). Through this embodied form of mobility (Hickey et al. 37), a correspondence between two entities, the researcher and the researched, within me was opened.\nThus, walking not only unveils the liminal space between the Old Self and the New Self but also provides a means to traverse it. Amid a psycho-socio-religious liminal state, an autoethnographer allows the New Self Becoming to confront the Old Self and talk. Before the long walk to San Pablo, I avoided revisiting my past as a Jehovah’s Witness. I used to think of those first 20 years of my life as a dark, wasted time, with nothing to contribute to where I am now other than as a reference point to whom I should not become. However, after the walk, my journal entries suggested that I was interested in inquiring about how my past could inform my current work. In my journal, I began comparing my life now and my life before and was surprised to realize that several elements of my old religious life were better than what I have now. Back then, I was embedded in a community. Back then, I worked hands-on with a historically marginalized community (the Deaf). I immediately saw that my work made a difference in other people’s lives. I do not have these things now, but I want them again. Although I will never achieve the clarity I had about who I was and what I wanted to do, I now see that there are elements in my former life that I want to reintegrate into my current life.\nInterestingly, my writings began discussing how my Old Self as a religious person still manifests in what I currently do. I started entertaining the idea that my work may still have religious elements even if I categorize myself as an agnostic. In my journal entry on August 29, 2022, more than two months after the long walk to San Pablo, I wrote:\nToday, I will be trying to understand whether what I am doing is indeed religious. Obviously, it is philosophical, and like Bugbee, I don’t have to articulate it and call it “religion” or even associate myself with the field of religion or religious studies. All I need to know is whether I could find inspiration from this field that I have been practically avoiding since 2012.\nWalking daily is a religious thing. Moreover, the great walkers I read, namely Henry David Thoreau and Henry Bugbee, all have works that can be described as religious (Marcel 31). I use religion in its generous, liberal sense, which is a commitment to a way of living based on principles regardless of where those principles come from. In my Old Self, I heavily relied on an organization to dictate those principles; in my New Self Becoming, I rely on myself to set my principles. However, both new and old identities share a common desire to be religious, and I would never have realized this had I not walked from Los Baños to San Pablo.\nHowever, what happened there on the walk? What made me talk to my Old Self that I have resisted, ignored, and intentionally distanced from for years? Ingold said that walking creates a space for correspondence for everyone participating in the research (“Life of Lines” 15). In my case, my Old Self and my New Self Becoming. Walking does this by “opening an opportunity for more irreverent, open and experimental dialogue” (Hickey et al. 50). Under a scorching sun, with only an umbrella to protect myself, forgetting to put on sunscreen or bring sunglasses, and burdened by the excessive luggage behind my back, what room is there for reverent dialogue? The physicality of walking prompted my New Self Becoming to loosen its guard, shatter the walls it built around itself, and finally confront what was always its research subject but unconsciously or consciously avoided: my Old Self.\nWhile walking, my New Self Becoming dropped from the tower it always occupied to join my Old Self below as both researcher and participant. By doing so, my New Self Becoming understood my Old Self better, finally confronting it as a worthy subject of study. And what a productive move this was because my Old Self held knowledge of the terrain that my New Self Becoming did not have (Hickey et al. 50). However, it was frightening to realize that perhaps my New Self Becoming has not yet moved that far away from my Old Self, that this new identity that thought it was novel was actually, still ancient, that what I was trying to walk through metaphorically was not an expanse but, in fact, an interstice.\nThis is what walking does to the autoethnographer on the threshold of identities. It reveals commonalities between past and present identities. It works as a form of transportation to help the autoethnographer traverse the “in-between realm, which forms a third place, or threshold, that links as it separates two previously opposed conditions” (Coleman 202). Walking allows one to relax and trust. Conversation with oneself is more natural than journaling at a desk, natural breaks are allowed, and visual cues in the environment become prompts for reflection.\nWhile walking one afternoon, I noticed a long line of flowers in two colors. At first, I thought they grew from different plants: one flower being a variant of the other. Upon closer inspection, I was surprised to see that the flowers grow from the same plant, although different in color. I would later learn that these were Umbrella Worts or more commonly known as Four O’clocks, because they open around that time, coinciding with my afternoon walks. This visual drama triggered thoughts on community—one of the things I lost after leaving my childhood religion. As a Jehovah’s Witness, I interacted with individuals who believed the same things I believed in almost daily. This was lost after I left. I have tried hard, even until now, to find community and accept that being in a liminal space such as where I am right now means coming at peace with the fact that I will not be connected to people I share similar beliefs with as easily as before and that differences and learning to navigate differences shall now be my norm. Walking and noticing Umbrella Worts and how two flowers of different colors could grow from the same plant made me ask whether growing a community despite differences is possible. This points me toward reincorporation.\nPerpetual Liminality or A Never-ending Walk #Derrida (1967) said that “deconstruction implies the possibility of rebuilding” (p. xlix). The rebuilding process starts with recognizing that one is in control of one’s destiny. Per Sartre (1946), existentialism and abandonment are related. Whatever its cause, abandonment involves detachment, a liminal condition that could be interpreted as an “autonomy of existence” (Al Shrbaji 76). Because no one is telling me what I need to do with my life, I have complete freedom to shape who I want to be and how I want to exist. From here lies the key to ending liminality and reaching the third phase of Van Gennep’s rite of passage: reincorporation. Implicit to the idea of liminality is that it has to end. I, who have lost community and a sense of identity, must eventually find a new community and identity. The correspondence between my Old Self and my New Self Becoming facilitated by the ambulatory inquiry that happens through walking must now point me towards arriving at that ever-elusive ideal: my New Self.\nIndeed, I have seen recent signs of reincorporation in my life. While walking on Session Road in Baguio City during my first visit in two years after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, I remembered how I used to walk the same pavement holding an umbrella under drizzles while wearing a polo shirt, slacks, leather shoes, and a bag hanging on my shoulder. I intuit that perhaps my unquenchable desire to walk and study walking came from all those years of walking as a minister of the Jehovah’s Witnesses visiting Deaf after Deaf scattered around the hills of Baguio City and La Trinidad. Perhaps, it is a subconscious compromise to an activity I could no longer do as part of the religious community I left. Walking reincorporated itself into my new life, my new identity, which until now, I have not fully articulated.\nWhy should it be articulated, however? Liminality is not a single flavor. It could be either transitional or perpetual—a social position that persists in ambiguity and expansive in loyalty (Ybema et al. 24). In peripatetic language, a perpetual psycho-socio-religious state is a never-ending walk. Regarding my religious identity, I like how the Unitarian minister Andrew James Brown put it: perpetual liminars desire “the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today,” which is precisely what walking signifies. As a metaphor for traversing liminality, walking reminds us that every day is a new walk. What only ends this daily recurring walk is the eventual perishing of the body. As long as it is here, the body, through movement, shall remind us of this perpetual liminality, this constant becoming, and helps us embrace it, traverse it, and perhaps even find ourselves at home en route to nowhere.\nWorks Cited #Al Shrbaji, Sarah. “On Walking in Derelict Urban Spaces: Experiencing Liminality in a City.” A Obra Nasce: Revista de Arquitetura e Urbanismo Da Universidade Fernando Pessoa, vol. 14, 2020, pp. 73–83. http://hdl.handle.net/10284/9885\nBrown, Andrew James. “The Freedom to Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today (Complete, Revised Version).” Caute, 2 Jan. 2023, https://andrewjbrown.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-freedom-to-be-tomorrow-what-we-are.html.\nColeman, Nathaniel.

It\u0026rsquo;s been a while, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy to be back.\nSubstack, the online app I used to run this newsletter from, sent me an automated email last March 21 reminding me that it has been four months since I last sent an email. Yesterday (May 21), that drought extended to six months.\nSo what happened and what will happen moving forward?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with what happened.\nAbout two weeks after I lost my best friend, an event I wrote about [[rewalking rem tanauan|here]], I lost my position at the agency I\u0026rsquo;ve worked as a freelance academic editor for the past three years.\nI discovered that grief and loss of income overpower any drive I have to write these emails. And the guilt that, somehow, losing my job took over the mental space I should\u0026rsquo;ve given to grieving my best friend\u0026rsquo;s loss and helping those he left, sucks whatever motivation is left for me to write.\nI tried to bounce back from the loss of income as fast as I could so that I could return to grieving and writing, but I soon found that these things have their own timeline. I could only do so much because the best opportunities present themselves unannounced, usually from people who are already in our lives.\nThe past six months have been a semester of learning optimism—perhaps even trust or faith. After many failed attempts applying to several agencies, I decided to look for my own clients. In March, I studied how to write email proposals and sent one to a prospect referred by a friend. The prospect was so impressed by my email and the sample I sent her that she invited me for an interview.\nI nailed both the interview and the writing test that came after, landing me the gig. I worked with this client for the entirety of March, a project that helped me review how to write a research paper the right way, something that proved to be very useful later (I\u0026rsquo;ll talk more about this in the next email).\nAround the same time, a previous employer I contacted last December to inquire about any projects they may need an extra hand with, finally returned to me and offered me a project. These two gigs kept me afloat these past six months.\nNow, I am in the middle of designing websites for two clients, who are also friends of mine. These projects will sustain me until July when I resume work with the research client I mentioned above.\nThis is the universe telling me to trust because everything is going to be alright. And this is why I have to get back to sending these emails, to writing for this newsletter—a project that has been so close to my heart for many years already.\nThings are still not perfect. I am nowhere near the income I used to have and I no longer have the luxury of working for a few days per month and a steady paycheck.\nBut I have enough mental space and courage to be grateful that it is a disservice to the universe, to you, and to myself, not to send an email. So, yes, I will be visiting your inboxes once more, and to start, I have two announcements to share.\nFirst, I am tweaking my newsletter system. I used to send different emails to different groups of subscribers. But I am sending these emails to only a handful of you that dividing you into groups doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense right now. So, I will be sending everything to this list—[[templates/tlw|The Long Walk list]]—moving forward.\nThat said, I will be putting categories of emails I will send to you in the subject line so you immediately know what email you are getting. Here are the categories:\nᜇ Updates – Occasional personal updates about my life like what you are reading right now. ᜇ Essay – Even more infrequent essays that are not necessarily about walking. These essays slowly grow from what I call [[my forest garden of the mind|my forest garden of the mind]]. ᜇ Poem – Oh, by the way, I\u0026rsquo;m also a poet. I\u0026rsquo;ll start sharing finished poems here. ᜇ Lilim – Occasional walking narratives. ᜇ A Book About LB – Yes, I am writing a book. The last category is also my second announcement.\nThis is what is going to happen moving forward. In the months to come, I will be sending dispatches to this email list about my first book project. The book is about Los Baños (LB), the municipality of Laguna, Philippines where I am currently located. Specifically, it will be about walking in LB and what that means not only on a cultural level but also on a deeper philosophical and existential level.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to start this project this year but I also intentionally delayed it due to the issues I mentioned above. Nevertheless, I seem to be okay now, enough to start something, to return home to writing and walking and poetry and photography—things that matter most to me.\nI will be sending the first ᜇ A Book About LB email very soon, hopefully, this week, so watch out for it. And if I haven\u0026rsquo;t said this enough before—thank you thank you thank you for being here.\nMore soon.\nV\n","date":"23 May 2023","permalink":"/tlw/017/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Updates: The Long Wait"},{"content":"I raised my head to look up at the roof of our house, but what I saw was the sky—light blue, almost lifeless.

I used the following names back then: life management system, physical health, mental health, relationships, sustenance, life work. On each life area, I review my goals from last year and check whether or not I accomplished them and why. Then, I share the other goals and projects that emerged last year in that area. Finally, I share my new goals in each area. At the end of that process, I set the following intentions (crossed-out goals were achieved):\nI have articulated my purpose, values, and big-picture vision for my life to make it easier for me to make decisions. I have established a better sleeping habit (eight hours a day from 11 PM to 7 AM). I have established a healthy, sustainable, time-efficient, and cost-effective nutrition system to improve my overall well-being. My throat has completely healed. I have further tapered my sertraline dosage to 1/4 pill a day. I have transformed my simple abode into a welcoming home for the important people in my life—people who I invite for meaningful and transformational conversations and camaraderie. I have helped my partner be accountable for her goal of saving for her emergency fund. I have supported my partner in becoming her healthiest self. I have articulated for myself clearly what kind of people I want to bring into my life and inner circle. I have proactively searched for my ideal people and nurtured relationships with them. I helped reunite my entire family at least once this year. I have implemented a budgeting system to use every month, while I haven’t yet improved my financial strategy. I have reevaluated my understanding, values, and general philosophy of money and the material world. I have reevaluated my editing work and decided whether to improve my editing skills or learn a new skill altogether. I have reevaluated whether to outsource my editing work. I have found a second source of stable income online. I have invested in high-risk, high-reward investment instruments. I have learned Linux and considered an open-source lifestyle. I have studied web design and created a new minimum-viable design for vinceimbat.com. I have studied web development to apply the new design for vinceimbat.com. I have learned to code. I have continued translating a sizable amount of Thoreau’s journal quotes. I have built a website for my Thoreau translations. I have established a habit of reaching out and conversing with my ideal audience: followers, peers, and mentors. I have researched individuals who asked “How to Live?” and studied how they study, live, share, connect, and facilitate their ideas to others. I have clearly articulated my Talahardin system using inspiration from Zettelkasten, the Evergreen note-taking system, and BASB. I have designed a beta version of an app for my Talahardin. I have planned, performed, and written about at least one long philosophical walk. The list above could have easily captured what 2022 was for me. But it doesn’t. I feel a mixture of shame and sadness as I look at it. I carried over some of these goals from 2021, yet I have not given them the attention they are asking of me. They still need to be fulfilled. A problematic question now confronts me: Do I still want these goals? Perhaps I still do; it’s just that I don’t have enough time last year to cover them all. I am still trying to figure out what happened here.\nIn an ideal world, I should have achieved all of these goals. But I don’t live in such a world. What happened in 2022 was far more than what I expected. Here is a narrative of what transpired in what is easily the best yet the most challenging year of my long walk (Note: I feel this with almost every year that passes).\nJanuary #I spent the first weeks of 2022 in study mode. I finished reading and taking notes on the book A Philosophy of Walking by Robert Gros. This beautifully written reflection on the meaning and uses of walking helped me understand the simplest mode of travel. I also re-read the article \u0026ldquo;The Moderate-Minded Writer\u0026rdquo; by Matthew Nisbet and began studying Thich Nhat Hanh’s work through the website of Plum Village.\nSince it is the beginning of the year, I also conducted my annual review, improving my process. One of my goals this year was to improve the design of my main website (vinceimbat.com) to improve how I share my work, so I also started learning web design and development. Along the way, I realized that there was so much to learn, so I created a temporary site so I could continue to publish even while learning to code. To practice, I chose a smaller project: a website for my Thoreau translations. I named the site Kaliskis na Ulap and used Hugo to build it. Through this project, I applied what I learned from the full-stack web development course I bought from Udemy.\nFebruary #I started my birth month by publishing the first issue of Uman, my newsletter that features monthly updates on my life and projects. After publishing it, I continued studying Thich Nhat Hanh. I particularly like his Understanding → Compassion → Happiness sequence and his distaste for ideologies.\nI also started re-reading Transcend by Scott Barry Kaufmann. It was a book I started the year before but never finished. Since one of my goals this year was to articulate my purpose, values, and vision, I decided to return to it. Through Transcend, I learned that my top three sources of self-actualization were continued freshness of appreciation, truth-seeking, and purpose.\nIn addition, I researched what existing fields of knowledge combined contemplation and philosophizing and where among these fields I could position myself. My hopes rose after I discovered Ran Lahav\u0026rsquo;s deep philosophy but later lost interest after I found that it puts a heavier emphasis on contemplation over philosophizing and that its epistemology favors experience over reason. This prompted me to read about the differences between rationalism and empiricism (rationalism vs empiricism).\nIt was also a month filled with web development projects. First, I continued studying web development, specifically HTML. I then discovered and implemented a solution to use a custom domain name for my notes in Craft, which I also used for my collection of Thoreau translations. Lastly, I decided to pull the trigger and migrate this website (vinceimbat.com) from WordPress to Hugo.\nRelationships-wise, I celebrated my birthday with a small group of friends, went home to the province to bond with cousins, attended an emotional wedding of two dear friends, and experienced the power of family as we faced a family member\u0026rsquo;s health issue.\nMarch #I spent most of March thinking about the question, “What motivates us humans?” This question was in line with my research on purpose and how I can better articulate it.\nI was interested in the conscious or unconscious reasons behind our actions. Psychology holds most of the answers to this question, so I stayed there for most of the month. However, I also reviewed philosophical answers. Specifically, I read and thought about the meaning of life. After combining insights from my readings in psychology and philosophy, I decided that, at the time being, my minimum viable purpose will be to self-actualize and transcend (i.e., to fulfill all my needs for security so that I could grow as a person and live my life in the service of humanity). This could change as I deepen my understanding of purpose and human motivation.\nWhile thinking about these things, I articulated the difference between meaning and purpose and wrote a very fruitful note on the relationship between nihilism and approaching life with humor. Inspired by my thinking about purpose and motivation this month, I realized I needed a more systematic way of tackling my goals. Through a journaling session, I wrote a draft of an outline on how to build a life management system implementation.\nMarch also featured several good walks:\na walk around Baguio for the first time since the pandemic, my first walk inside Makiling Botanic Gardens, discovering what would be my favorite trail along Matic-Matic–Maronong Road, walking with my cousin and her fiance in Baguio, and a solo walk at Yellow Trail. Aside from walks, this month was also a month of travels. I went to Baguio to see my nephew and nieces for the first time in two years. I also traveled with some friends to San Nicolas and saw Taal up close (after it blew up some ashes!). I also joined my partner\u0026rsquo;s family for an outing at Calayo, Nasugbu, Batangas.\nApril #April started with me contemplating my inevitable mortality. My contemplation led me to the realization that what is truly important in life are not the peak experiences but the plateau experiences. The value of plateau experiences comes only after several brushes with death and suffering—experiences that make one wiser.\nThe connection between plateau experiences, death, and wisdom is as follows: When one wants to see things as they really are, driven by curiosity and truth-seeking, one quickly realizes that everything is fleeting. This realization of the fleetingness of life then leads to more intentional living: one wants to make the most out of this short precious life.\nThinking about my life\u0026rsquo;s fleetingness led me to ask myself what I wanted to do with the time I had left. The answer that came to me was that I wanted to write a book. I spent a considerable amount of time this month thinking about what kind of book to write and realized that I wanted to give birth to the following:\nbeautiful non-fiction books with photographs that combine personal narratives, philosophical thinking, cultural references, and historical descriptions, all situated in a specific geographical location.\nTo facilitate this project, I wanted to manage better the intermediate packets that could lead to writing a book. Thus, I transferred my notes from Craft to Obsidian.\nAfter setting up my notes, I began compiling a reading list of books and essays about place and nature that discuss what it means to live and draw resources from history, culture, science, philosophy, and every possible source. This led me to writers who were influenced by Thoreau, such as Annie Dillard and Edward Abbey. While reading all of these books about nature, a common practice among the authors emerged: Everyone described specific moments of profound observation of particular phenomena in nature. Because of this, I was inspired to go back to writing field notes during my walks, which I rewrite as vignettes in my journal.\nMeanwhile, I sent my blackout poems to be included in the Tuloy-Daloy exhibit, visited the Rizal Shrine for the first time, did my second hike to Mt. Makiling, traveled to Baguio City with my partner, and, finally, got my family together for the first time after two years.\nMay #In May, I continued incorporating narratives into my digital garden. As I did this, I began thinking deeper about my writing life. I read DIY MFA by Gabriela Pereira. One of my most significant writing achievements this month was narrativizing the April 2022 issue of Uman.\nAs I progressed in writing, so did I in walking. I decided to improve my walking by increasing the time I spent outdoors in the afternoon. The more time I spend walking, the more chances I could have of catching something worth writing about. Extending my walking time led me to write longer, more beautiful field notes, which convinced me to relaunch Lilim. I published three issues of Lilim in May. It was during one of these walks that I serendipitously discovered the story of the LB internment camp, which I wrote about in Lilim 030 — Where Grass Once Turned Crimson. After reading about the story at the UPLB library, I spent an entire afternoon tracing the possible boundaries of the camp. During this walk, the draft of the poem Baker Hall, 1927– came to me.\nThe other walks I did this month were a walk at Lopez Quezon, around town, in one of the fishponds at Sta. Teresa, and at Santino\u0026rsquo;s Farmville. I also had my second Makiling hike this month.\nJune #In June, I walked from Los Baños to San Pablo, passing by the towns of Bay and Calauan along the way. It was my first multi-day walk; the second day I spent going around Sampaloc lake and visiting Bunot lake. While walking towards San Pablo, the difficulty of the walk, which I think owes more to rookie mistakes than the trail itself, made me ponder why I was doing the walk in the first place. I did the walk early this month, so I considered a lot about my motivations for walking the entire month. I journaled about it, thought about it on my next walks, and wrote a whole Lilim article on it called \u0026ldquo;Why Walk?\u0026rdquo;.\nThe walk also encouraged me to return to photography. I wanted to take good photos and edit them better during the walk, so I decided to improve my photography skills. This education extended even after the walk. I created a systematic, custom-made photography learning roadmap to organize my learning.\nAfter doing photography and walking for almost a month, I felt the urge to return to my foundation: philosophy and contemplation. I reminded myself that my walks and photos would be more meaningful if I am more intentional about them, that is if I use them to deepen my sense of meaning. To facilitate this meaning-making, I continued to sharpen my writing this month. I continued marinating myself in narratives, which helped me elevate my experiences while walking.\nAnother highlight of June was ordering, unboxing, and reading Kissa by Kissa by Craig Mod. I read the book in two sittings and learned a lot about walking, books, and photography—stuff I could use in my work.\nJuly #This month, I spent a huge amount of time thinking about Thoreau. I studied his medium (the romantic excursion) and his quest to live his unique version of transcendentalism. More importantly, I studied his philosophical stance, which showed how different he is from me. Reading about Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s quest inspired me to think about my own quest. A huge part of this quest is the work that does not involve others, just myself. The writing I do in private is my most important writing. This writing is philosophical as it is meant to help me make sense of and understand my life and the world.\nI spent more time thinking about the kind of philosophy that I want to practice, and this led me to lyrical philosophy per Edward Mooney. This research on lyrical philosophy introduced me to Henry Bugbee and, later on, ordinary language philosophy, specifically the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. My research on philosophy sharpened the kind of writing I want to produce. I want to create artifacts of writing around universal subject matters, which are place-based and use the romantic excursion as their device.\nThis month, I also worked on preparing a few poems to be sent to TLDTD for potential publication. The experience was very instructional. On photography, I created a photography learning roadmap that I would follow once I am ready to return to photography. On walking, I published a couple of Lilim issues, and while walking with my father and mother for the first time in a long time, I was reunited with Tita Sabel, a Deaf woman who took care of me when I was a baby.\nLastly, I modified how I prioritized goals. I created a comprehensive list of life goals and divided it into five primary focus goals and an extensive list of what is left called an “avoid-at-all-cost list.”\nAugust #In August, I went deeper into understanding how to incorporate lyrical philosophy into my writing by studying Henry Bugbee and his work, particularly The Inward Morning, which I wrote commentaries about. Responding to his epistemology, I began valuing my fieldnotes better and giving them a specific category in my notes garden (\u0026ldquo;seeds\u0026rdquo;). I also explored the work of Andrew J. Brown. Through these readings and explorations, I began looking closer at the religious nature of my work, and I faced head-on something that I was unconsciously avoiding: accepting that I am still engaged in religious activity and my past religious life has several things to teach me about living my current life.\nIn writing, I published one Lilim issue and several walk vignettes in draft form. I also received good news from TLDTD that my poem Gawat and its translation Tagsalat will be published in their Issue No. 5.\nThe main project that occupied me this month was transitioning my website into a digital garden using Quartz and combining all my notes and blog posts into a single ecosystem where writings grow from seeds to seedlings and eventually evergreens.\nSeptember #This month, I spent the majority of my days thinking about money and how it relates to the life I want to live. I read the book You Need a Budget and then applied it by creating my budget, helping my partner create hers, and building our couple fund budget for our second month living together. We needed a system that could help us talk about money easily, and we found the YNAB system and app really helpful.\nWhile budgeting, I realized I needed to earn more money to retire earlier than the traditional retirement age. However, I was no longer willing to increase my working hours at my freelance job (editing). It became clear that if I wanted to improve my earnings, I needed to start a source of income closer to my passions. While thinking about this, I encountered the career capital theory by Cal Newport, which argues that if I want an ideal career, I need to develop a rare skill in exchange for it. I felt an intuitive reservation about the theory because it treats everything we do like something to be exchanged and treats careers like competition. This made me remember that some important work are necessary even if unprofitable. I remembered gift economics and decided to spend the remaining days of September reading the book The Gift by Lewis Hyde.\nIn other news, I went on two dates with friends: one in Pagsanjan and another at Las Piñas. I also celebrated my third anniversary with my partner, adopted a new cat, and rescued a kitten.\nOctober #I started October intending to do a creative reset. After re-reading Steal Like an Artist, I decided to publish The Long Walk (TLW) on Substack. The first issue was released on October 9, 2022, and it shared the highlights of my mental and physical walks. I was able to publish two more issues on The Inward Morning and Our Invisible Walden. The issues contained highlights of my reading of The Inward Morning by Henry Bugbee, the foreword of Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You by Rofel Brion, and Living Philosophy by Edward Mooney. The issues showed how I started building my philosophical family tree. It also presented my deepening appreciation and integration of poetry into my philosophical practice, culminating in the book launch of Saglit, where I met Rofel at Casa San Pablo.\nMeanwhile, Carillon came into our lives, Benjie and I started a photography project together, and Lea and I went home to Pangasinan to spend two days at the beach.\nThings were going well until we were all struck by the sudden death of my best friend, Rem Tanauan. Rem\u0026rsquo;s death forced me to look at my life and work and has reoriented my priorities into helping the people that Rem left move on. I am also called to protect Rem\u0026rsquo;s private and public writings and get to know him more through this. I am also finally committing to mastering poetry.\nNovember #Rem\u0026rsquo;s death made me closer to my community. Thinking about the meaning of community made me realize the importance of having a metaphysical and epistemological home that I could return to as I practice tolerance and compassion toward others who do not believe my fundamental beliefs. This led me to the metaphor of walking and the well, which also applies to poetics and living in general.\nWhile I contemplated community, I helped a friend translate the foreword of her upcoming book, walked with some friends at Makiling Botanic Gardens, and shared space with others at the Ginhawa Breathing Space event at Tanay, Rizal. There, I walked around the Hermitage and Organic Gardens (HOGAR) of the Institute for Consecrated Life in Asia (ICLA) and did a hike to Mt. Kulis with my partner and some old and new friends. The trip helped me grieve Rem and provided some much-needed inspiration to write a few poems and some issues of TLW.\nAfter the trip, I focused on contributing to a small group of Rem\u0026rsquo;s friends who wanted to preserve his works and continue his legacy. I also read the book Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans to provide some ideas on how I could incorporate the new insights I had about my life work after Rem\u0026rsquo;s death and think better about adjustments I wanted to do in my work life.\nDecember #I mainly spent the last month of the year thinking about my sources of income. I wanted to create a livelihood system (as I like to call it) that is both resilient and encourages my transition toward more satisfying work. At present, I support my art through freelance editing. I realized that editing no longer provides the same fulfillment it once did. Also, I needed to introduce multiple income streams to my system to create a safety net.\nI contacted a previous employer and asked if they had any project they could use a hand with. Fortunately, they have a writing project and offered me a trial run. I also started writing podcast show notes again.\nMy partner brought up the idea of me helping her with her systems. Since this is a potential business idea I have been thinking about for a long time, I gladly accepted the challenge. I spent the last week of the month going back to my thoughts on how to build a minimum viable life management system and creating a prototype course for her. We are currently doing the course together, with me coaching her step-by-step. So far, this project has provided me with helpful ideas on how I might proceed with this endeavor.\nWhile working on my partner’s LMS, I also took the opportunity to improve my own LMS. I redesigned my daily routine to accommodate better sleeping habits and incorporated the Pomodoro app Forest into my morning routine.\nThis month, I wrote a few poems and several poem drafts and released two TLW issues, the last of which involved a narration of my realizations from watching stars for over a week while at Cablong. In addition, I finalized a plan for improving and maintaining Rem’s websites, which I shared with our small group.\nWhile at Cablong, I also had several good walks. My favorites were walking to Banaoang, discovering a heavily graffitied house, and walking under a full moon.\nThis month also allowed me to nurture my relationships and start new ones. I began a friendship with some Pangasinan writers or kumukurits who, like me, are doing their best to help preserve the dying Pangasinan language. I also attended a freelancers’ event with my partner, where I got to meet new and old friends.\nMy holidays were beautifully silent. I spent Christmas and New Year at my apartment in Los Baños with my partner and our cats. During the dead week between Christmas and New Year, we met with three friends. But that’s about it. My 2023 started with me hugging my partner as we looked out the window, watching a fireworks display that lasted just about five minutes.\n***\nIn 2023, I have two big goals: (1) to establish a more resilient livelihood system that encourages me to transition to doing work that I enjoy more and (2) to start a book project (possibly about walking in Los Baños). I have other goals, but they serve different support roles for these two. I do not doubt that other important goals will emerge along the way. Hopefully, I will be ready to face them when they do.\n","date":"12 January 2023","permalink":"/essays/2022-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"2022 Annual Review"},{"content":"Nangungulila ako\nsa mga gabing\nparang akin ang buong campus\nwalang mga estudyanteng nagtitilian\nwalang kotseng bumubusina sa likuran\nako lang ang naglalakad\nsa sidewalk\nsa ilalim ng mga palmera\nsa ilalim ng sirang bombilyang\numaandap-andap kapag malayo ka\ntumitigil kapag nasa tapat ka na niya.\nTignan ang orihinal sa talahardin.\n","date":"30 December 2022","permalink":"/buhian/gabi-sa-campus/","section":"Buhians","summary":"","title":"Gabi sa Campus"},{"content":" When I got off the bus on the evening of December 2, there was a single tricycle waiting at the entrance of the provincial road that would lead me home. Its LED lights shined brightly as the driver waited silently in the dark.\nI approached him and asked, Can you bring me to Sitio Bayog? He spoke gently, respectfully, almost in a whisper: No, I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for someone.\nSince it became clear to me that I had missed my last ride, I turned towards home to start walking. But the driver spoke again. If you want, you can ride with us. My child is already at Tebag.\nAnd so I went back to the tricycle and sat behind him. Your son is studying? I asked. Yes. Third-year engineering student at UCU, he said.\nAfter about a minute or so, his son arrived across the road around the same point where I got off the bus a few moments ago. He ran toward us when the road was clear and went straight inside the sidecar. The driver turned the engine on, and we started our way toward Payas.\nThroughout our eight-minute ride together, in between long silences, we talked about the rising incidence of holdups in the area and people we both know (mostly my aunts and uncles). When we arrived at the entrance to Garcia Street, he stopped and asked if I wanted him to enter. I said, No need. I can walk.\nI got off and held his shoulders with my right arm. Thank you so much uncle, I said. May I know your name? Again, with his gentle, almost silent voice, he said, I\u0026rsquo;m Oscar.\nAfter saying another round of thanks, I saw the father and son off and started walking the short walk home. It was around 6:30 pm, and the sky was dark enough for me to see the stars.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been here for more than a week and have intentionally walked in the evening to stare at the night sky. This is embarrassing to admit, but before the Ginhawa Breathing Space event at Tanay, which I attended last month, I never really knew what lights I was looking at at the heavens when I raised my head at night. All I knew then was that the lights that flickered were stars, while the lights that shined steadily were planets.\nUsing the SkyView app on my phone and the pointers I remember from the stargazing session we did at Tanay, I can now identify Mars, Jupiter, Neptune, and the constellations Orion, Taurus, Gemini, Aries, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Some nights, when I feel more geeky than usual, or when there is too much cloud in the sky, I would identify a completely unfamiliar star, usually, the one that shines the brightest.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this walking and stargazing for more than a week now that yesterday, I started to feel something—something both familiar yet seldomly felt. When I look long enough at celestial beings—the stars, the planets, and the moon (especially the moon)—something unexpected happens.\nI start to feel small and insignificant.\nI remember that the star I am looking at now was probably already dead thousands or billions of years ago, and what I am seeing is only the light it has emitted long ago—a light that is older than me, older than anyone alive on earth today, older than my great, great ancestors.\nAnd with this reminder comes the recognition that everything I am looking at above came before me. And, like them, I arose from nowhere. This existence that I possess came outside my volition. I was brought here by someone (or something) that is way more powerful than myself. My existence was never my choice. It was beyond my control, much like almost everything else around me—aging, illness, and death.\nInterestingly, I recently came across [[thich nhat hanh|Thich Nhat Hanh]] ’s English translation of The Five Remembrances of Buddhism.\nI am of the nature to grow old.\nThere is no way to escape growing old.\nI am of the nature to have ill health.\nThere is no way to escape ill health.\nI am of the nature to die.\nThere is no way to escape death.\nAll that is dear to me and everyone I love\nare of the nature to change.\nThere is no way to escape being separated from them.\nMy actions are my only true belongings.\nI cannot escape the consequences of my actions.\nMy actions are the ground upon which I stand.\nWhen I look up at the sky, I am also reminded of the question that has troubled human beings for millennia—a question that continues to perplex philosophers, scientists, and theologians: Where did all of these come from?\nWhen I think about this question, I remember Aristotle and the notion of the \u0026ldquo;[[Unmoved Mover]]\u0026rdquo; in Book XI of his Metaphysics. The most basic argument behind the notion of the Unmoved Mover is that everything that is in motion was moved by something else. However, there cannot be an infinite cause of moving things because this goes against the rules of logic. Infinity in the physical universe cannot exist! This means one thing: there has to be an ultimate cause.\nOnce this agreement is reached, we face a new problem: What is the nature of this Unmoved Mover? This ultimate cause could never be moved—it is unmoved. Otherwise, it was also caused by something else. Likewise, it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be made of physical matter. Otherwise, it is subject to change and, therefore, moved. As if that isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, it also must lack potentiality. Therefore, it is simply actuality.\nThe nature of this \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo;—this Unmoved Mover—is so mysterious that I cannot help but feel awe as I contemplate it while looking up at the night sky. And this feeling—this awe—is interesting because it feels so sharply in contrast to the ego expansion that happens when I am in the social world.\nWhen surrounded by people in broad daylight (or electric light), my ego wants to be seen. Like a hungry wolf, it cries—cries for attention. But whenever I walk under the dim light of the stars or the soft light of a full moon, enveloped by this constellation of darkness, silence, and slowness, my ego shrinks—quite rapidly. And with this shrinking comes the peeling off of layers and layers of my onion self until what is left is emptiness—the empty space where everything else flows.\nIn this space something weird happens, something which Jeanette Winterson caught accurately:\nI have noticed that when all the lights are on, people tend to talk about what they are doing—their outer lives. Sitting round in candlelight or firelight, people start to talk about how they are feeling—their inner lives. They speak subjectively, they argue less, there are longer pauses.\nTo sit alone without any electric light is curiously creative. I have my best ideas at dawn or at nightfall, but not if I switch on the lights—then I start thinking about projects, deadlines, demands, and the shadows and shapes of the house become objects, not suggestions, things that need to be done, not a background to thought.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t this exactly what we need right now?\nIn a time where it is so difficult to love others let alone love ourselves, we need the darkness of the night more than anything else to allow the possibility of vulnerability and, therefore, love and compassion.\nCarl Sagan said it precisely:\nFor small creatures such as we the vastness of the universe is bearable only through love.\nLove is what will get us through this wonderful yet frightening existence. Love is what will get us through all of the things beyond our control—growing old, ill health, and death—all the more so because, while nature is beautiful, nature can also be very, very harsh.\nThis seemingly paradoxical quality of nature was articulated beautifully through this quote from Terrence Malick\u0026rsquo;s brilliant film Tree of Life, which I shall leave here to end this essay.\nThe nuns taught us there are two ways through life, the way of Nature and the way of Grace. You have to choose which one you’ll follow.\nGrace doesn’t try to please itself. Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked. Accepts insults and injuries.\nNature only wants to please itself. Get others to please it too. Likes to lord it over them. To have its own way. It finds reasons to be unhappy when all the world is shining around it. And love is smiling through all things.\nThey taught us that no one who ever loves the way of grace ever comes to a bad end.\nI will be true to you. Whatever comes.\n","date":"11 December 2022","permalink":"/tlw/013/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"When I Look Up at the Night Sky"},{"content":" There is joy in clean laundry.\nAll is forgiven in water, sun\nand air.

Here is the description of Memory on Mayer’s official website:\nIn July 1971, Mayer began experimenting with her memory. She shot a roll of 35mm film each day, and kept a rigorous daily journal. The project resulted in a staggering total of 1,100 photographs and nearly six hours of recorded poetry.\nPhotography and poetry as media for individual experience? Sounds like my cup of tea. You can view some of Mayer’s photographs here.\nNovember 29, Tuesday #In my journal, I reflected on what I could learn from my impatience while waiting for my laundry. I wrote:\nIt’s funny how something as trivial as an undone laundry could affect one’s going about in life. I think a good number of evidence proves that I am an impatient person or that I have a tendency for impatience. And this triggers anger. But more importantly as it is more dangerous—it develops distrust to fellow human beings. Instead of having my laundry done by someone else, I buy a washing machine and do it myself. Instead of riding public transpo, I buy my own car and drive it myself, avoiding rude drivers, conductors, and passengers. But can we really find fault in the person who chooses to rely on himself at this day and age when quality of action and real genuine care is really low? Perhaps this is the reason why people search for churches and cling to them—little societies where the utopia could be built—where shared values and beliefs are nurtured, protected, and members find camaraderie and friends among each other.\nNovember 30, Wednesday #When we woke up, I invited Lea to walk with me to Freedom Park and meditate there. After meditating, it started to rain, so we had to go home.\nBack home, I tried journaling, but words won’t come out. So I did what I often do when words don’t come: I drew.\nActually, I still wrote, but I did not generate the words. I simply hand-copied Rofel Brion’s Filipino poem Lumot (moss) on a journal page using a brush pen, which I used for the first time. I then watched this Lynda Barry video on following a wandering line and did the exercise around the poem. Lynda Barry is one of my favorite artists, and I even became more fond of her after learning that she was half Filipino.\nI watched another of her videos, the one about using the brush pen to make vertical lines. After seeing the lines, I felt the urge to draw a portrait. So I drew Rofel’s portrait in the middle of the lines. I showed it to Rofel, and thankfully he liked it!\nDecember 1, Thursday #On Rem Tanauan’s 40th day after his passing, along with his family and a few friends, we remembered, once more, how much we lost.\nDecember 2, Friday #I set on an eight to nine-hour trip from Los Baños to Pangasinan. While in transit, I chatted with a Pangasinense kumukurit (writer) who writes anlong (poems) like me. He befriended me the night before, perhaps after seeing my poem at TLTD, and started a conversation about the state of Pangasinan literature. Through Melchor E. Orpilla, a social studies teacher at Unibersidad de Dagupan, I learned that an existing group champions the Pangasinan language and its literature. The group’s name is Ulupan na Pansiansiay Salitan Pangasinan (UPSP), which roughly translates to the Association of Preserving the Pangasinan Language. The group has a magazine, the Balon Silew (New Light), and a small but vibrant community of Pangasinan writers do exist. Learning about this was a relief. I was both inspired and intimidated. Here are writers with a deeper knowledge of my mother tongue than I do, who write poems and self-publishes them while recognizing that readers are few and all efforts are but a resuscitation of an endangered language. Meanwhile, I left Pangasinan because I couldn’t find a community of artists there, writing anlong from afar.\nMelchor E. Orpilla has written a book of poems, Lainëng ed Casborran, and a translation of a Katipunan colonel’s war memoir.\nDecember 3, Saturday #I had dinner and some laughter in the company of family.\nDecember 4, Sunday #After meditation and journaling, I wrote a poem in Pangasinan in my journal using the brush pen, then translated it into Filipino and English.\nI leave you with these poems.\nUMAGA SA CABLONG\nNaghaharutan ang mga bata\nsa kalsada parang\nmga pipit sa bubong.\nSubalit ikaw\ntaimtim mong hinahayaang\nisayaw ng hangin\nang mga dahon mong\nnagpapanariwa\nsa mga kaluluwa namin.\nMORNING IN CABLONG\nChildren romp on the streets\nlike these sparrows\non the roof.\nBut you,\nyou earnestly allow\nthe wind to sway\nyour leaves\nthat mend\nour souls.\n","date":"4 December 2022","permalink":"/tlw/012/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Reflections on Laundry"},{"content":" What is the colour of wind?\n~ A koan\nI’m Vince Imbat, and this is The Long Walk.\nThe Long Walk: November 21 to 26, 2022 #November 21, Monday #I went to [[a metaphysical walk|a group retreat in the mountains of Tanay]] over the weekend, hoping to get some more time with myself in nature. But the retreat felt more like an outing than a retreat, so as I returned to Los Baños, I felt like the real retreat was just about to begin.\nDuring the last sesshin (接心) I attended in 2018, our sensei Elda, in her closing talk, mentioned that the real sesshin begins the moment we leave the ICM Convent in Baguio, where the five-day silent retreat was held. The real sesshin is out there in the world, she said. I reflect on what my life looks like, and it feels like a never-ending retreat, a pseudo-monastic life.\nSpeaking of sesshins, the first post-COVID sesshin in Baguio has just culminated this November. Unfortunately, I learned about it ex post facto, so all I could do is to wait for the next one on April 2023. Sitting once more for long hours and long days in silence would be nice.\nIn my digital note garden, I wrote the following [[explore your worldview like a walk|note]]:\nExplore metaphysical and epistemological beliefs as if it is a walk\nPerhaps developing our metaphysical beliefs also involves this careful walking. Building a home, a minimum viable one, starting with just a few principles then going out to try things out. Exposing oneself to as much beliefs as one can. But returning to the center.\nI remember Andrew James Brown’s similar method for what he calls “metaphysical hitchhiking”:\nWell, in a nutshell, it is simply to have in mind an appropriately confident sense of the general direction and horizon towards which it seems best to travel and also to have adopted a general minimalist form of life and style of movement that seems appropriately suited to help us take steps in that same general direction.\nSo how on earth are we to distinguish between missteps and sidesteps and the kind of steps that seem to us to right and which move us in what we feel is the right direction? Well, that can only achieved by those who find a way with a clean heart and full belief (pathos) to commit loyally to some kind of minimal, general sense of direction of travel and an associated minimalist, or basic form of life and style of movement that will help then navigate towards that horizon. (emphases mine)\nNovember 22, Tuesday #One of the exercises in the book Designing Your Life, which I am slowly realizing is a compelling book that integrates a lot of lessons I have learned in the past about career planning and job searching, is writing your philosophy of work (workview) and philosophy of life (lifeview). After writing [[my workview]] and [[my lifeview]], I reflected on how the two relate to each other.\nI realized that both my worview and my lifeview have this minimalist and balanced view of money that acknowledges its importance but only as a supportive element. I internally agree that the most important things happen not in exchange spaces but in gift spaces. I realized that I have never truly been driven by money. I have been very cheap in my life and could be even cheaper if needed. The more I don’t think about how I can generate more income, the better. On a related tangent, because the main work is inner and its movement is slow, fame is not part of the equation. I am never motivated by it.\nThat said, I see a contradiction between my philosophy of work and my life philosophy that needs to be immediately addressed. I still see work mainly as a tool to generate income. While money is supportive, work treated simply as something secondary to the real vocation I want to do could damage how I show up in this area of life. Is there a way to treat my income-generating activities as an integrated extension of my vocation, even if that vocation happens in the gift space? This is a question I continue to ponder about.\nNovember 23, Wednesday #Continuing the exercises in [[designing your life burnett and evans|Designing Your Life]], I went down memory lane. I listed all work- and nonwork-related activities I have engaged in throughout the years and graded each in terms of engagement and energy levels. I also placed a star on activities that brought me to flow. For each activity that induced flow, I wrote a quick reflection about what was happening during each activity that made the experience incredible. The authors of the book called this a “good time journal.”\nWhile washing the dishes, I listened to a TED interview with the poet Ross Gay about joy.\nIn the afternoon, I took a grounding, comforting, and pleasant walk along Pili Drive.\nNovember 24, Thursday #In my journal, I wrote some common threads I noticed in my list of activities in my good time journal so far.\ncreating stories make me flow. Either fiction or nonfiction. there are two big areas in my life: CREATIVITY \u0026amp; SPIRITUALITY. I do my best work when I am alone. there should always be an element of aloneness even if I want to work with other people. November 25, Friday #From all the activities I listed in my good time journal, I chose three: one that engaged me, energized me, and made me flow. I chose creating stories, walking, and photography for each, respectively. As the book instructed, I made a mindmap for each activity. I set a timer for six minutes and rigorously wrote the first words that came to me.\nAfter this, I went back to each mindmap, looked at their outer rings, and encircled three words that jumped to me. As the book instructed, I created a job description with a drawing incorporating those three words. I did this for each mind map. The results were:\nCreating stories -\u0026gt; sign language tour, self-directed learning, poetry -\u0026gt; a self-directed learning poetry tour with Deaf participants Walking -\u0026gt; Tanay Rizal, ancient aliens, mindfulness -\u0026gt; a history/cosmological + well-being retreat at a nature-filled environment like Tanay Photography -\u0026gt; journaling, indigenous peoples, numinous -\u0026gt; a book project about indigenous creative spirituality as described in old journa This was one of the most fun and eye-opening activities I have done in a long time. The purpose of the activity was not as much to arrive at answers as to shift my mind from “what is next” to “what is possible.” This is precisely what it did.\nIn the late afternoon, I walked at Jose Drilon Jr. Street alongside an arm of the Molawin Creek and sat at the end of the road to sketch my first odyssey plan, a five-year plan of the current life I was living. This was still part of the exercises in the Designing Your Life book.\nNovember 26, Saturday #Right after waking up, Lea and I walked toward Forestry at UPLB. Under one of the sheds, we sketched our odyssey plans and presented them to each other. We drew three odyssey plans each:\nA five-year plan of what we are currently doing or have planned for A five-year plan for an alternative life if number one suddenly becomes impossible to realize A five-year plan for an alternative life when money and image were no issues Lea presented her three plans: as a copywriter, a dentist, and a “hippie” resort owner. Then I showed mine: a writer of many genres, a self-directed learning facilitator, and a manager of a farm for artists and learners.\nHere is what that last one looks like.\nIn the afternoon, I read the latest Nightingalingale newsletter by Craig Mod, a newsletter he sends to his membership patrons about the process of writing his latest book. He wrote about the importance of scale in creative projects.\nScale is something I’ve discussed in the past. I think it’s one of the most “important” choices someone who is doing “creative work” has to make: What scale do you want to work at? Because so much flows from that choice.\nI decided ages ago that “my scale” was relatively constrained, mainly because I have a fairly uncompromising sense of what I want to do, which is not always the most \u0026ldquo;commercially viable\u0026rdquo; thing, and I have very little patience for bullshit. The bigger your scale, the more bullshit against which you have to defend (the more complex the thing becomes: the more moving parts, the more people involved, the more money at stake).\nImportant to note that even small scale things can be crippled by bullshit; vigilance is critical — the worst situation is one where you’re working on a small-impact item that acts like it’s a Big Deal and comes with all attendant Big Deal Bullshit.\u0026quot;\nAfter reading this, I returned to my odyssey plans and asked myself, “Do these plans reflect the scale that I want to work in?”\nI picked up new pieces of paper. There is a plan that needs revising.\n","date":"28 November 2022","permalink":"/tlw/011/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"The Real Sesshin"},{"content":" Truth is always common and plain.\n~ Shin’ichirō Imaoka\nI’m Vince Imbat, and this is The Long Walk.\nThe Long Walk: November 14 to 20, 2022 #November 14, Monday #In my forest garden of the mind, I wrote the following note.\nMetaphysics and epistemology map out the terrain for the long walk\nMetaphysics and epistemology are useful in informing how I can live because they are the only tools that could get me to what is true. Knowing what is true is useful because human beings have been thinking for a long, long time that theories abound about how we should live abound to the point where the terrain is very muddled.\nThe question that metaphysics answers (What exists?) and epistemology answers (How do I know what I know?) are like a compass. The answers I get from contemplating them allow me to see the terrain and create a map out of it. When the terrain is mapped, it is easier for me to answer the question that I am most interested in: How must I live?\nAfter writing the note, I transferred a draft of a poem I wrote yesterday evening while walking.\nNaiiyak rin ang sansinukob\nMalayo pa pala ako\nsa bukana\nng daang pinasukan ko.\nLumalalim na ang gabi\nat ako\u0026rsquo;y pagod at gutom na.\nNaalala kita\nat naiiyak ako muli\nkaya ako\u0026rsquo;y\ntumingala sa langit.\nSa aking pagtingala\nsa langit na itim na itim\ndagling nahulog ang bulalakaw.\nNaiiyak rin ata\nang sansinukob.\nIn the afternoon, while on a call with a friend, I heard him utter these most reassuring words: “Do not feel guilty about your choice not to build community with people you don’t have relationships with. A community is made up, first and foremost, of relationships. When there is no relationship, there is no community.”\nNovember 15, Tuesday #I consulted the I Ching on a question I asked today, “How do I balance going back to my source and helping others?”\nI cast the coins, and Hexagram 46 appeared. In Hilary Barrett’s translation, the reading was as follows:\nPushing upward, creating success from the source. Make use of seeing great people. Do not worry. Set forth to the south, good fortune.\nThe image associated with the hexagram was that of a small measuring ladle. The ladle was a metaphor for performing small, measured actions one step at a time. According to the reading, this was how the many things that could be done at this time would be done. The task also encouraged meeting “great people” and letting go of worry.\nI do not believe in divination; therefore, I could not see the I Ching as a tool. But, as I, along with many other creatives and thinkers, will attest, the I Ching is a useful “uncertainty machine” that could prompt our thinking to get out of our habitual mental boxes.\nThis reading provided a helpful metaphor for what I could do while navigating my grief and my desire to actively help others at this time. Interestingly, the metaphor coincides with the metaphor of walking and the well, which I explored last week. The way to ensure that we can actively do something for others while at the same time being mindful of our own needs is to strengthen our source (our well, mind, body, etc.) and then leave that source to help others incrementally—walking this distance today, returning to our source, then increasing the distance tomorrow. This incremental walking is similar to what the small ladle in Hexagram 46 does.\nNovember 16, Wednesday #In the morning, when I woke up, I was welcomed by an unexpected problem.\nIt broke my morning routine, evidenced by the fact that I started the day re-reading an Aeon article I read way back about the I Ching as an uncertainty machine. After reading, I took a long walk on the campus, resting on one of the benches at the park under the shade of trees where I journaled. In my journal, I confronted the new problem. I berated myself and asked, “Why do I always have to learn my lessons the hard way?”\nWhen I went home, I shared the thought with my partner, and she didn’t like it. She grabbed her phone and had me read one of her favorite newsletter articles. I read the article, and it was about a successful woman who asked herself the same berating question. She noticed that, like me, she always had to go through a tough challenge before she started to change. To stop this cycle, she intended to improve her life as much as she could, but when things started to go south, she would “ask the universe” for two gentle warnings, which she calls “feathers,” before getting a “hard rock”—the disaster. Once those feathers arrived, she promised to respond to either and not wait for the hard rock to come before making adjustments. While I am still unsure how to use it, I find this a good metaphor and an important lesson.\nNovember 17, Thursday #I started reading the foreword of the book Designing Your Life.\nIn the evening, Lea and I walked until Viado. She left earlier while I continued walking. The walk was captivating and grounding. It helped me feel that I must go back to my source before making a good decision about the situation.\nWhile walking, the idea came to me: What if I facilitate awe and doubt?\nNovember 18, Friday #I read the first chapter of Designing Your Life. I made the book’s first exercise, a life design assessment of four life areas: work, health, play, and love. I took the assessment and found that all my areas are half-filled—I have done enough to manage them but not enough to feel fulfilled. Half of the work is left undone.\nThe book also introduced the concepts of lifeview and workview. Workview is your philosophy of work. It states what work is for you and what it means to you in general. It defines what good work deserves to be. On the other hand, lifeview is similar to what I would call your life philosophy. It is your idea of what the world is and how it works. The chapter introduced questions one can ask to write a short articulation of one’s workview and lifeview. I am answering the questions slowly.\nNovember 19, Saturday #Today, Lea and I left town to visit Hogar (or Hermitage and Organic Gardens) at Tanay, Rizal, a mountainous municipality in Southern Luzon, for a group retreat. We arrived along with other participants around 3 pm. After eating, I was instructed to go to my cottage and set my things up before returning for the opening program. I was staying by myself in the farthest cabin where I would be sleeping alone tonight.\nThe path towards the cottage was a muddy grass walk with some large plates of stone followed by a long winding flight of stairs. Before reaching my cottage, I passed by another where a friend who was yet to arrive would be staying. When I saw mine, I was pleased. It had a little porch where one could be silent if the indoors became unbearable. However, the indoors proved pleasing for me, who had just arrived. It had a dining table and chairs, a small kitchen, a restroom, and a bed, which could accommodate a single person. The religious stay here for a few days, even months, as part of their formation. Knowing this made my visit inside a bit inspiring.\nAfter fixing my things and taking a quick shower, I descended from my hill back to the mess hall. All of us participants were gathered for a few words of welcome. After this, we were led outside to be introduced to the surroundings. We walked a stairwell of soil and rocks that crossed a garden called the Garden of Prayer. To my surprise, the Garden led to my cottage above the hill. I taught some participants and showed them my cottage.\nAfter the walk, we gathered back to the mess hall for dinner. Over dinner, I talked with a few participants about the state of education in the country. Two in our group were teachers—one taught in high school, while the other taught at an online university. We all agreed that more schools and teachers need to be given more academic freedom if they are to stir the boat in the right direction. We also decided that young people are being asked too early to commit to a career when they should be exploring as many subjects as possible before making a decision or, better yet, never being discouraged from changing far along the way.\nAfter dinner, we all assembled at another building to introduce ourselves formally, listen to some stories, and make some art. It was raining most of the time, but the sky gave us some two-hour clearing, from 9:30 to 11:30 pm, to lie down on the ground and watch the stars. Through the help of an app and the guidance of a trained participant, I saw Mars, Jupiter, Sirius, and the Aquarius constellation.\nBy 11 pm, I felt I wanted to be alone and do what I intended for this time—a time for me to think alone in a beautiful geographic space. And so, I said my goodbyes and returned to my cottage while the others were still watching the skies between jokes and stories.\nIn my journal that night, I wrote the following words:\nWhether you believe on a God or not, you cannot deny one thing: you did not create yourself. You were put here by someone or something that is way more powerful than you. And this thing is filled with myster. The answers about its nature are not intuitive. They have to be pondered about—sometimes, felt. And this is enough, this awe, to move one to appreciate everything—every moment while one is alive. But this thing is usually lost to us. My calling, my gift, is to remind people, to call them towards this state of depth.\nMy vision is to work with people one on one—a life of retreat and communion, of going back to my well by going out to help others. I plan on constructing a purely naturalistic belief system, my house, then from ther, get out. Where this will lead me, I still don’t know. But I ultimately want to walk into the wilderness of compassion.\nNovember 20, Sunday #I woke up around 6:30 am and immediately started preparing to go out. I was set to walk the trail up to what they said was a cafe above the hill. Before walking, I cannot help but take photos of the hermitage cottage’s surroundings.\nTwo trails led to the cafe. I took the left trail first. Along the path, several small bamboo trees grew on the side. My feet landed on some stairs made of mud and wood. At one point in the trail, I saw the mountains. Staying here for a couple of months should change anyone.\nWhen I reached the top, I saw a better view of Hogar and its neighboring resorts. I saw the Hogar cafe. It was open, but no one was inside. It began raining, and it was clear to me that I won’t be able to journal or meditate outdoors. So I made my way down using the right trail. I took a short detour to see what was at the end of an okra garden. What I saw was the fence that separated Hogar from a neighboring resort. On my way down, I saw a tiny snail, a baby still growing its shell. It was under a large leaf.\nI walked further down to catch breakfast, which was closing in about 30 minutes. After breakfast, we started preparing for the hike to Mt. Kulis. Mini, one of the organizers, led us. The walk towards the entrance of Fresno Agro-Forestry and Eco Tourist Campsite, which houses the trail to Mt. Kulis, was a wide dirt road with mud. Only cars, particularly those with large wheels, could pass. Not even tricycles or motorcycles could make it with ease. We walked on the sides. Some of us decided not to continue. The adventurous at heart pushed on. We were soon rewarded with some of the best views in Southern Luzon.\nAlong the trail to the summit of Mt. Kulis, we saw what they called Noah’s ark from afar. But it was more like a large balangay placed on top of a mountain.\nMeanwhile, the view at Mt. Kulis was breathtaking. It was too much to wrap one’s head around; I almost didn’t leave. While there, my friend Cris shared with me his Baybayin script-inspired ikebana. Cris plays some great music as well. He is a really aesthetically sophisticated individual.\nI shouldn’t have left the summit, but through persuasion, I decided to join the crew to walk to the other attractions.\nWe made our way back by walking again. The walk back needed the same mindfulness that brought us there, perhaps more. We reached Hogar around 12:30 pm, just in time to have lunch. I used my lunch time talking with Reg, the head of the deaf studies initiative at UP Diliman. I left the Deaf community about a decade ago. My conversation with him reminded me that there was a time in my life when I felt that advocating for the Deaf was my calling. While I no longer feel the same passion I had for sign language as I had back then, the Deaf community is still close to my heart, and I am open to doing something, anything, in the future related to Deaf culture and sign language.\nWhile in transit back to Los Baños, I started reading the essays of Shin’ichirō Imaoka on free religion. After reading the first three essays, I learned that Imaoka’s idea of free religion is seeing religion in everything. Religion, to him, is simply making the human being whole. This is the same goal of education. But it also happens in the secular areas of politics and economics. For Imaoka, everything falls under the umbrella category of religion.\nI read about his history of religious and spiritual training, which led him to his position as a free religionist. I learned about his precepts:\nI believe in myself. I believe in other people. I believe in a cooperative society. I believe in a universal cooperative society. I believe in the church. I notice the concentric nature of his precepts, similar to my recent meditations on the well and walking. Religion, to him, starts within oneself and extends to the entire universe.\nI also read an article about the Unitarian Universalist Church of the Philippines, which made me even more curious about this religion. Imaoka was unitarian. I wonder if anyone in the UUCP shares his ideas on free religion.\nFrom Calamba central terminal, we rode a notoriously slow jeep to Los Baños. At first, I was pissed off at the driver. Then I remembered I just came from a retreat, which was supposed to slow everything down.\nPerhaps my training isn’t over.\n","date":"22 November 2022","permalink":"/tlw/010/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"A Metaphysical Walk Along the Mountains of Rizal"},{"content":"Malayo pa pala ako sa bukana\nng daang pinasukan ko.\nLumalalim na ang gabi\nat ako\u0026rsquo;y pagod at gutom na.\nNaalala kita at naiiyak ako muli\nsubalit hindi ko na kayang bumalik\nkaya tumingala ako\nupang pigilan ang pagtulo ng luha.\nSa pagtingala ko\nsa itim na itim na kalangitan\nang luhang \u0026lsquo;di ko kayang ipatak\ndagling nahulog na bulalakaw.\nTignan ang orihinal sa talahardin.\n","date":"14 November 2022","permalink":"/buhian/naiiyak-din-ang-sansinukob/","section":"Buhians","summary":"","title":"Naiiyak Din ang Sansinukob"},{"content":" Drink water from your own cistern\nflowing water from your own well.\n~ Proverbs 5:15\nI\u0026rsquo;m Vince Imbat, and this is The Long Walk.\nI am an editor by profession. I chose to keep a day job to support my writing so I don’t feel pressured to make money out of it. This week was a working week—a marathon of editing, a communion with the material world, which I found was also a rest from grief. I did walk in the evenings after work. And in those walks, the mind, again, confronts the questions of existence alongside the regrets of an aching heart.\nHere is the past week\u0026rsquo;s walk.\nThe Long Walk: November 7 to 12, 2022 #November 7, Monday #In the evening, while I was walking, I contemplated the relevance of our beliefs about what exists (metaphysics) with our desire to belong. I wrote:\nMetaphysics make us feel like we belong, like we don’t have to tolerate or exert effort. It is rest. It is home. We need to get out of our metaphysical comfort zones but we need to return to these spaces to feel home.\nThis is the reason why we join churches. In those churches, everyone believes the same things. The trouble of tolerating others’ metaphysical beliefs is lessened if not completely removed. We don’t have to debate. We can rest and focus on what is more important to us: friendships, romance, and the pursuit of a good life.\nI look at my current circles and see that none of them really share my metaphysical beliefs. I am not part of any agnostic or atheistic circles even if I am one. Every interaction, therefore, involves stretching my tolerance muscles, getting used to listening, hearing, and sometimes even using the language of others that I don’t necessarily believe in. I think this has served well to increase my compassion and my ability to really empathize. But it can be tiring especially if I don’t have a “metaphysical home” to go back to.\nNovember 8, Tuesday #I am entertaining the possibility of writing a biography for Rem Tanauan. But this is a long-term project. It ought to be. Archival materials have to be gathered and preserved. Also, there is the issue of emotion. Write the biography this early and you won’t gain the wisdom that only time could reveal. And this wisdom is important because it will tell how much to reveal to the world. Reveal everything and you might hurt people, especially those who loved the person whose story you are writing about. Reveal too little and you risk people deifying a perfect yet dishonest image of the person. The story will be written. But it should be written in its own time.\nIn the evening, I sat down on the empty bleachers in front of a softball field, alone in the dark. I looked up and stared at the stars for about 15 minutes.\nNovember 9, Wednesday #One of the conversations I wish Rem and I had more was about the uses of I Ching by a secular person. I asked him a few weeks before his death how the I Ching could help an atheist or an agnostic. He said the I Ching is like water. It takes the form of the vessel it pours into, and so the I Ching could be used purely as a philosophical text that could prompt a philosophical conversation.\nI remember this conversation and so I dug some more. People were asking the same question in Quora.\nNovember 10, Thursday #After watching this clip by the comedian Bo Burnham, I started questioning again how much of our social media use is preventing us from really hearing our deepest thoughts. For writers, philosophers, poets, and artists, hearing oneself is everything. And so this is an issue that I continue to grapple with. I am sure of one thing: the less I use social media, the more I think and write better. This is because I am able to maintain a deeper focus on a line of thought.\nNovember 11, Friday #In my journal, I returned to what I was thinking about last Monday (Nov. 7)—the relationship of our metaphysical beliefs with our desire for belongingness. I developed this journal entry into a note in my forest garden of the mind. Here is the note:\nWe feel belongingness to people we share metaphysical and epistemological beliefs with\nThe Buddha avoided metaphysics. He said it was unimportant and that it prevented us from being compassionate to each other. Overemphasizing our beliefs in metaphysics and epistemology can definitely make us hateful especially when the two are combined into one ideology. We agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology. But metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder. It will always be part of our conversation about how to relate with other people.\nFor example, I want to clarify my metaphysical and epistemological beliefs because I first need to create a place of belonging within myself. I first need to feel at home in my body. I want to feel really safe and autonomous and to protect that safe space as much as I can. And from there, expand my sense of belonging. The challenge is of course compassion—to love people outside that circle of belonging that we are ever so interested in building and preserving.\nThis is the reason why building my worldview through understanding is so important to me and why my immediate environment is so important to me and why I want to be careful and intentional in my relationships.\nTo illustrate the note, I drew concentric circles.\nThe more I leave the center of the circle (my mind and body), the more I leave my comfort zone—my ginhawa. But leaving that comfort zone allows me to grow and create more meaning as it is only within the context of my relationships that I truly flourish. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a happiness researcher, agrees:\nPerhaps most critical to improving and maintaining happiness is the ability to connect with other people and to create meaningful connecting moments…\nBut how often could I leave that center of comfort and for how long without compromising it?\nI continued exploring the website of the Unitarian minister Andrew James Brown. I first checked a new page he added to his site: Free Religion. It was a page introducing Shinichiro Imaoka, the advocate for free religion in Japan. I downloaded two free books: one his only biography and the other a collection of selected writings on free religion. Then I also read his short biography.\nNovember 12, Saturday #In the morning, I spent another long journaling session—about two hours—continuing the thread of thought that came to me the previous day. I started by simplifying my life areas into six:\nOverseeing - creating and maintaining structures for managing life Understanding - building your own worldview and philosophy of living and using that knowledge to inform your actions Restoring - maintaining and optimizing health Connecting - building and maintaining relationships Sustaining - providing and managing material and financial resources Creating - nurturing mastery and joy in different forms of art Previously, I used “Life Work” as a category separate from “Mental Health” or “Physical Health.” But I know now that living my life is itself my life work, so it no longer makes any sense to continue treating it as something separate.\nThese life areas act like tags rather than boxes. This means that one project could target multiple areas. For example, a vacation trip to visit relatives can both be an opportunity to rest (restoring) and bond with family (connecting).\nThese categorizations are an important part of the contemplation I do about building a life management system that helps me track my goals, actions, and knowledge, that is, my attempt to practice intentional living.\nI contemplated whether there could be a process I could follow to set up and then nurture these different life areas in a manner that feels right. And, of course, there is! I remembered the metaphor of walking, which I have been exploring since before I launched this newsletter, and thought about the concentric circles I drew above. I then mapped out the following process.\nSet up your home base (i.e., your own worldview, understanding yourself, setting up boundaries, knowing your preferences, establishing practices, curating your immediate physical space) to make it the safest and most autonomous space you can be in. Your home base consists of your mind, body, and your immediate physical space. When you are ready, walk your figurative neighborhood and attempt to build and nurture an inner circle—a circle of trust, a support system of close friends, family, or mentors. Use that inner circle to cultivate mutually beneficial support in your attempts to strengthen each other’s home base. When you are ready, extend your walk towards town and start challenging yourself to expand your knowledge about others, to open yourself to surprise and dialogue, and to find opportunities to grow among different but still like-minded or like-hearted people. Eventually, when your home base is strong, your inner circle solid, and your outer circle thriving, you may feel the challenge to explore what I call “the wilderness of compassion.” You will walk outside the gates of the town and into an arid, potentially unfriendly wilderness. This is beyond your comfort zone, beyond what you think is possible, but it also provides you with the biggest opportunity to grow, transcend, and explore what might be possible with the human heart. Could you, for instance, love the unloveable? Could you feel comfort alongside someone who is at the opposite end of your comfort zone? These are questions only answered by heeding the call of walking into the wilderness. This philosophy of living, creating, and connecting illustrated by the metaphor of walking has some similarities with the metaphor of the well (balon) that my late friend, which I miss so much, Rem Tanauan, has developed in his poetry course. Here is a translation of a Filipino reflection I wrote this week about the similarities of the metaphors of walking and the well.\nThis morning, I have been on my journal for two hours already. I could feel my voice returning, hearing it, no longer just a whisper. I was contemplating the similarities of Rem’s metaphor of the well and the metaphor of walking, which I am currently exploring. Both are metaphors with wide applications but they are sharp in their similarities as metaphors of how to create and how to live.\nIntegral to Rem’s metaphor of the well is returning to it always. Because everything we share to the world as a human and an artist comes from it. The same goes with the metaphor of walking. One needs to return home after several hours of walking to restore strength, heal, and meditate on the things realized and seen outdoors.\nThese metaphors are anchored in a view that life indeed is difficult but that we can always return to a source that we can coax comfort that we may go back into the world and do what we want to do.\nIntegral in this philosophy and poetics of well-being is not hurrying, slowing down, carefulness, and a deep knowledge of self first before going out and doing.\nAfter I journal, I usually read one or two poems. When I opened Rofel Brion’s Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You, this was the first poem that caught my attention.\n","date":"14 November 2022","permalink":"/tlw/009/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Walking and the Well"},{"content":" Lahat tayo\u0026rsquo;y aninong\nsa langit humaharap.\nLahat tayo\u0026rsquo;y karimlang\nuuwi sa liwanag.\nWe are all shadows\nthat stand before cosmos.\nWe are all darkness\nand to light we go home.\n~ Rem Tanauan\nI\u0026rsquo;m Vince Imbat, and this is The Long Walk.\nOn October 23, 2022, right after I published the third issue of this newsletter, I received the sad news that Rem Tanauan—my poetry and translation mentor who I also considered my closest friend—passed on. This issue of The Long Walk presents the footsteps I have taken so far in the valley of grief between remembering Rem and trying to move forward.\nThe Long Walk: October 24 to November 5, 2022 #October 24, Monday #It was difficult to fall asleep after learning about what happened to Rem. But I tried. In the morning, when I woke up, I wrote a very brief journal entry.\nYesterday, I lost a friend. The only truest, closest, most genuine friend I’ve ever had….\nI need to go back to the steps we took together. I need to re-walk my dear friend’s life. I am still in shock. Still in denial.\nI started re-walking my friend’s life per necessity. His family needed photos, both his best portraits and those with friends and family. I went through my entire photo library, chose the best samples, edited a few, and uploaded the photos to a shared Google drive.\nAfter re-walking my friendship with Rem in photos, I took a real walk to let thoughts and memories flow. I came home with a handful of words I still didn’t know where to put.\nOctober 25, Tuesday #I woke up earlier than usual to catch one of the earliest buses to Cubao. My goal was to arrive at Los Baños in the afternoon and visit Rem’s wake in the evening. The trip took more time than I expected, which made it impossible to go to the wake. During the trip, I killed time by listening to music in between writing more thoughts and memories about Rem.\nOctober 26, Wednesday #I needed something to read on Rem’s eulogy night. The original piece was a collage of the thoughts and memories that came to me in the past two days since learning about Rem’s death. While raw and real, reading them in public didn’t really feel right. Perhaps it was not their time. I listened to Lea’s advice to write things I would’ve wanted to tell Rem. So I rewrote the entire piece and did just that.\nIn the afternoon, I visited Rem’s wake for the first time and helped hold his first eulogy night. I knew Rem was good with people, but for the first time in my entire six years of friendship with him, I saw how much deep love Rem was able to flow into this world. I didn’t realize how large his network of communities was and how much people are grieving his loss until I saw it through my own eyes. There were lots of tears shed. But there were also laughter and joy that night. We were all still grieving, but at last, we had hope.\nSomewhere in my Obsidian vault, I wrote:\nRem’s leaving has left me with a profound existential crisis I have never felt since my depression in 2011 when I left my childhood religion. That was my first awakening. This might be my second.\nFor the first time since 2011, I considered the possibility of doing some “pastoral” work. Inspired by Rem’s ability to connect with each life he has touched on a deep level, I realized I wanted something similar in my life. I was no longer content with publishing a weekly newsletter and calling myself a writer. I wanted to connect with people in flesh and listen to them as I figure out how best I can help. But is there a place for an agnostic like me in that kind of work? I sent a message to a common mentor I shared with Rem. I also read the article “Why Would an Agnostic Do Interfaith Work?” and found the beginning of an answer:\n“..do you have to be black in order to see the oppression of African-Americans and fight for racial equality? Or LGTBQ to fight for marriage equality? Why, then, must I be religious in order to see a need for interfaith dialogue?”\nOctober 28, Friday #I helped hold a second eulogy for Rem on the last night of his wake. We stayed after the eulogy and slept on the chapel’s pew chairs together with his family.\nOctober 29, Saturday #We left the chapel early in the morning. We wanted to go home to Los Baños to get more sleep before going back to Batangas for Rem’s internment at 2 pm. We arrived home after about two hours of travel. By 11 am, the electricity was gone. By lunchtime, the wind started to get stronger. By 1 pm, torrential rain was pouring. Lea and I decided not to proceed.\nWe wouldn’t have made it, not even with our own car. In the evening, all entry and exit points to the crematoria were flooded as the strongest storm of the year graced Rem’s ashes with its presence.\nOctober 30, Sunday #Nothing can be done on the computer or outdoors, so we made it through the day by writing in our journals, reading, and catching up on sleep. Perhaps, a total retreat from the world and our daily comforts were what we needed at this time.\nOctober 31, Monday #This was Rem’s ninth day after death. Tagalogs call it pasiyam (siyam meaning “nine”). But for me, it was my first return to Rem’s house, the house I was privileged to visit several times throughout the span of our almost six years of friendship. Crossing the street towards the gate was hard, walking on the balcony where we stayed for hours on end talking about poetry was harder, but entering his room hit me the most. There, Rem’s books stared at me. But there was no Rem on the bed where we had many loud laughs before going to sleep. What was only there were some petals on an altar built for him.\nIn the afternoon, I joined the family walk at a secluded park, which Rem did what might have been his last walk of solitude. There, long and heavy bamboo stems blocked the pathways. We had to duck to pass under them and see the fishponds. This is a beautiful place. I can only wonder what poems may have come to Rem as he walked around here.\nThat evening, I walked home alone.\nNovember 1, Tuesday #I did a long journaling session while contemplating the things I can do to help Rem’s friends and family and projects I could start (whenever I am ready) to help continue Rem’s vision or integrate them with mine. Two things I have committed to after Rem’s departure are (1) deepening my poetry practice and (2) continuing my friendship with Rem by communing with his public and private writings.\nNovember 2, Wednesday #I can feel that my days are starting to go back to their old routine. In the morning after meditation, I journaled quickly about what October meant for me and what I plan on doing this November. I then plunged into review mode—finances, goals, etc.\nI felt like Lea rewarded me with a hearty dinner, after which, I rewarded myself with an evening walk alone. On the walk, raw words came to me…\nKakalahati palang ang buwan\ntulad ng buhay mong\nhindi pa natapos\nsa pag-inog.\n…and a few more…\nNang makita ko\nang dagsa ng tao\nsa lamay mo,\nnapagtanto kong\nmaari naman palang\nmabuhay ng makabuluhan\nkahit aapatnapung taon lang.\nBack home, we watched a good movie before retiring to bed.\nNovember 3, Thursday #I felt my philosophical voice return after almost two weeks of retreating into the background. On my digital forest garden, I wrote the following note:\nAmoralism does not prevent me from feeling strongly against certain behaviors\nJust because I am an amoralist doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that I will have to love the unloveable. Amoralism is a metaphysical stance, which means I am simply believing on a statement about what does or does not exist. In this case, the claim that I am persuaded into is that there are no absolute, objective, and naturally occuring values.\nThis belief does not prevent me from feeling strongly about certain behaviors like abusive and violent behaviors. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to be around poeple exhibiting these behaviors and if there is a way for me to prevent them from abusing more, and I am in that capacity, then I should act. I am acting purely out of emotions and practical reasons.\nMy difference from a moralist could simply be that I do not use talk about \u0026ldquo;inherent rights\u0026rdquo; or morality to achieve my goals. But I could imagine a situation where I feel very strongly about protecting victims or would-be victims from an abuser. Amoralism does not automatically make me good or bad. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t even want to use those words. Amoralism does not automatically make me an advocate for safety and lessening of suffering. But it does help me to see things as they really are and from there, hopefully I can lead to my desired course of action.\nIn the middle of a bath, words more refined than yesterday came to me:\nSumasabay\nsa daloy ng tubig\nna ibinubuhos ko\nsa aking ulo\nang daloy\nng mga\nalala mo.\nIn the evening, while washing the dishes, I finished listening to a podcast conversation between the Riverside Interfaith Council and the Inland Empire Atheists and Agnostics. The conversation reaffirmed my desire to live in a pluralistic world with no single ideology dominating and where peace is possible despite differences in beliefs. This was a vision I shared with Rem.\nNovember 4, Friday #I started communing with Rem’s public writings. First, I read the overview of his blog Pathfinder’s Commune then wrote a reflection on it. You can read it by clicking on this title: “Reflections on the overview of Pathfinders Commune.” In this piece, I reflected on how Rem combined his earlier desire to be a teacher with his latter desire to be a facilitator.\nIn the evening, I met with some friends to share dinner and grieve together.\nNovember 5, Saturday #What better way to cap this two weeks’ worth of re-walking Rem Tanaua than to re-walk him once more? In the morning, Lea and I, together with another close friend accompanied the woman Rem loved the most to re-walk the steps they took together 13 years ago inside the Makiling Botanic Gardens.\nHere, along the eco-trail leading toward the dipterocarp trees, Rem started his real communion with Love. To re-walk the trail is to re-walk his masterpiece—a masterpiece, which he shared with his other half. And like any other masterpiece, his footsteps will never be recreated no matter how much anyone tries. We can only emulate but never truly recreate what he did—what they did. We can only watch and witness and remember that once, not a long time ago, someone like us tried—no, did his best—to make the most of his one long meandering walk. To bear witness to this and be part of it is one of the greatest gifts I have ever received.\nPagbaba sa batis\nsa may mga bato\ndi mawari\nkung tutubi\no ikaw\nang inaantay ko.\n","date":"11 November 2022","permalink":"/tlw/008/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Re-walking Rem Tanauan"},{"content":" a hole inside me\ngapes open wide, expanding\nsmarting to be filled\nby something I have yet to find\n~ Rofel Brion\nI\u0026rsquo;m Vince Imbat and this is The Long Walk.\nHere is the past week\u0026rsquo;s walk.\nThe Long Walk: October 17 to 22, 2022 #October 17, Monday #In the morning, I decided to do my journaling and reading outdoors. My partner, Lea, agreed to come along. The sun was scorching hot when we left the house. But as we reached Freedom Park, the sky started to grow dark. Here goes Los Baños\u0026rsquo; bipolar weather.\nThe grass was wet throughout the park and under the Fertility Tree, so we decided to sit on one of the benches surrounding the Carillon tower.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d already done some writing when we heard it. A loud meowing from afar started to grow louder.\nThen everything happened so fast.\nAnts started biting my feet. They crawled on Lea\u0026rsquo;s sandals. We stood up and started walking away, unsure where to go next. But then we saw it, the source of the peculiarly loud meowing—a grown kitten following a male student intermittently looking behind at the noisy creature, appearing slightly surprised that it had chosen him as a target.\nI want to look at it, Lea said, so we approached the kitten. Lea took it and peeked at its genitals. It\u0026rsquo;s a girl! She carried it on her bosom.\nWe named it Carillon (after a week-long debate).\nAnd we did remember Keeley.\nBack at home, while still on my yoga mat, I started reading the foreword to Rofel Brion’s book Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You, a collection of his Filipino poems with their corresponding English translations. The English translations were originally Rofel’s, but he had his friend Noelle de Jesus edit them. Noelle’s translation process inspired me to try translating Rofel’s poem Umaga (Morning) into Pangasinan. My translation isn’t done, but I discovered a downloadable Pangasinan–English dictionary along the way. My mother tongue, Pangasinan, is a dying language in the Philippines. I’ve been having a lot of difficulty finding a Pangasinan dictionary, so this one, although aged, was a big find for me.\nOn my computer, I reviewed a note I wrote a while back entitled “Our invisible Walden.” In the note, I wrote:\nWe have the same questions to answer—they are inescapable: How should I live? Where do I get instructions for living? How do I understand the world?\nToday, many of us don\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of living for two years in a cabin in the woods. But like Thoreau, we can\u0026rsquo;t escape the questions. Its all a matter of \u0026ldquo;when\u0026rdquo; do we start getting serious about them. \u0026ldquo;When\u0026rdquo; do we face our invisible Waldens to build our invisible cabins and start thinking about the questions seriously. When do we say \u0026ldquo;Enough. I am answering the questions myself.”\nWhile washing the dishes in the evening, I listened to a podcast episode about the analytic and continental divide in philosophy. As I am slowly building my philosophical family tree, this is an issue I could not escape. The analytic–continental divide refers to a widespread assumption that there are two general traditions in philosophy: one that emphasizes clarity (analytic) and one that doesn’t (continental).\nOctober 18, Tuesday #I reviewed my highlights from the foreword of Kapag Natagpuan Kita = Once I Find You. In general, the foreword was an illuminating account of how a “translation by collaboration” could happen. I reflected on how Noelle de Jesus quickly acknowledged that she was not a poet and, in her words, a “learned speaker or writer of Tagalog or Filipino.” Instead of feeling less qualified to do the job of editing Rofel’s translations because of her “inadequacies,” she embraced them and had them guide her on choosing the approach she used to deliver the project.\nLiteralness. I took refuge in the literal. Not being a poet, interesting or otherwise, that was the kind of translation I sought, a word-for-word version that was correct in meaning first, poetic in English second, if at all.\nThis choice is sometimes shunned by poem translators, many of which are capable poets themselves. But Noelle does not hide who she is. She proclaims the truth to the world and stands by it. From Noelle, I learn honesty, authenticity, and courage to be who we are.\nI continued to study the analytic–continental divide in philosophy and am starting to share the conclusion of Brian Leiter that the divide is sociological and not intellectual. Moving forward, I intend to practice a form of philosophy that recognizes the value of both analysis and lyric, a practice that merges both clarity and depth, a way of looking at the world that is interested in both objective and subjective truth. In other words, a holistic worldview.\nOctober 19, Wednesday #With Lea, I traveled to my home province of Pangasinan to see my family and stay by the beach for a couple of days. Dickinson’s poem from last week’s newsletter and Rofel’s poem Umaga (Morning) strengthened my resolve to see the sea before October ends.\nHere is Emily, once more…\nExultation is the going\nOf an inland soul to sea,\nPast the houses — past the headlands —\nInto deep eternity —\nand Rofel (with Noelle’s edits, of course)…\nSo early in the morning\nwaves already crest high,\ndark skies approach\nin the distance,\nover there,\nin the deep, filled\nwith a great breadth of creatures\nwhose colors alone, they say,\nwill amaze you.\nSo they sally forth,\nbrave the sea, descend into it,\nand leave me dumbstruck,\nwith only my feet wet.\nThe long bus ride afforded me some time to check substacks. Here are three good ones I am currently exploring:\nUnder the Net. The substack of philosopher Kieran Setiya. He writes general audience books that use philosophy to tackle practical life problems. His new book Life is Hard, which just came out this October, discusses navigating personal trauma and injustice in the world through philosophy. Photo Meditations. A newsletter by George Bothamley that combines photography with poetry and philosophical reflection—something The Long Walk also tries to do. Mind OS. A newsletter about personal knowledge management (PKM) and its philosophical and psychological basis. I haven’t read it yet, but since I geek on PKM and the graphs and titles in this newsletter looked interesting enough, I decided to subscribe. Between long naps during a five-hour bus ride, I did some reading. I continued Living Philosophy by Mooney, and I finished Chapter 5—a chapter about the lyrical philosophy of characters in Moby Dick.\nOctober 20, Thursday #After waking up, I walked with my father for about an hour at the Matic-matic–Maronong road. The last time we walked together was back in 2011 when I was recovering from depression. He doesn’t know this, but it is that long already. So this morning’s walk was something special.\nAfter walking, and while waiting for breakfast, I journaled about yesterday’s reading of Living Philosophy. For the first time in the book, Ed Mooney presented the possibility of having analytic philosophy and lyrical philosophy coexist in one practice (or even in one piece of writing). This connected with what I am currently learning about the myth of the analytic–continental divide in philosophy. Mooney recognizes that it is possible to have multiple visions in a single work. However, for such coexistence to occur, we need to let go of the dominance of our obsession with “airtight and universal principles” and allow subjective, episodic, and ever-shifting philosophical truth to have an equal footing. The best philosophical texts present an objective account alongside a subjective one. One can be clear and straightforward while also being poetic.\nAfter breakfast, Lea and I went to the beach. At the beachfront, we napped and journaled (more). I found a few moments of silence and I was graced by a poem.\nWHAT I HAVE\nFences block the sea\nfrom where I sit\nand so I just listen\nto the sound\nof water plunging\non water\nthen vanishes\nforever.\nThe sky was too cloudy for sunset, so we walked instead, until evening. Finally, I am in deep eternity.\nOctober 21, Friday #I woke up at 6:30 am and started walking towards the beach. The sun is already up. On the beach, an adult male, possibly in his 60s, was with a little girl, around three or four years old. She was his grandchild, perhaps. His apo.\nThe child was walking around the man, chasing a few dogs with them. The dogs were free. They seem to know the beach well.\nI walked towards San Fabian and saw the Cordillera enveloped by a thick gray mist. Below me, tiny transparent crabs, almost invisible to the eye, moved from one hole to another. Beside the holes, large footprints—not of man but dog—pressed on the soft sand, so soft I felt so heavy.\nOn the sand, near the crabs and the pawprints, I sat for a while, watching the waves and feeling sunlight on my cheeks.\nOn my way back, I saw a man dragging his bike towards the water. He looked as if he was ready to plunge the bike on the sea. But he stopped and dragged it along the edges of the beach instead. He did this for about a minute, then he dragged his bike back to the concrete road.\nAs I made my way back to the resort, I saw an old man on the side of the road looking far into the horizon.\nOctober 22, Saturday #After watching Lea ride the bus bound to Manila, I walked back home on my own, about two kilometers of concrete. Along the way, I saw farmers opening up their sacks of ilik (unmilled rice), laying them out on the road to dry. I walked on the edges of the road, avoiding the ilik.\nIn the afternoon, I sat to review highlights I took from the second chapter of Living Philosophy. I clustered a few interrelated highlights that began to make a coherent thought. I flowed.\nFirst, I wrote what I understood was Mooney’s argument:\nMooney claims that a work can have an effect on us, or we can engage with it, without analysis (i.e., despite not knowing about the biography of its creator or its history). In fact, to be truly present with the work, we might need to intentionally let go of analysis. Mooney says \u0026ldquo;the mysteries of creation lie on the surface.\u0026rdquo; You don\u0026rsquo;t have to get deep to witness them. Mooney seems to suggest that a work of art presents with it a particular \u0026ldquo;mystery.\u0026rdquo; This is obvious. When we encounter a work of art the first time, we know nothing about it. Mooney says you don\u0026rsquo;t have to search for this mystery, it is evidently there on the surface. And the mystery is not something to be sold, it is something you linger into. Mooney clarifies that letting mystery take over does not mean being ignorant or shutting down questioning. It is giving space to wonder.\nIn Zettelkasten parlance, what I wrote was a “literature note.” I reflected on this note and allowed it to trigger thoughts that I remember from past writings—writings that were written from my unique perspective. I wrote:\nA product of creativity possesses an inherent mystery. When faced with one, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is. We don\u0026rsquo;t have to look for this mystery. It is evident in the surface. There are two ways of engaging with this mystery: (1) We analyze it and treat it as a problem to solve or (2) we linger with it to see if it could have an unspoken effect on us. The former is an active engagement with the work, while the latter is a passive way of being with a work. If we are moved by it, we won\u0026rsquo;t choose it.\nWhen faced with an image, a poem, or a prose, it might be helpful to allow yourself to enjoy it without the pressure to analyze. Analysis is paralyzing and could get in the way of really enjoying or even truly understanding a work. I remember DIY MFA, which mentioned that you need to analyze works of art you want to emulate but not all and not every element. So, when engaging with a work, let yourself be present with it, take note of things that jump to you. Return, but only analyze if truly called for. Otherwise, let the initial resonace suffice.\nThis last note is what is called a “permanent note.” But as it is now, it isn’t yet permanent enough. I add it to my writing inbox, where I shall continue developing it whenever I feel like returning to it.\nAfter writing, I read the latest newsletter article from George Bothamley’s substack Photo Meditations. It was entitled “Beginner Mind.”\nA few paragraphs jumped to me. This one, in particular, was pretty insightful:\nImagine having the kind of mind that can contemplate all the stars and heavens above . . . and yet, allowing yourself to slip into this sense of tedium.\nOr imagine having a heart and soul capable of creating art, music, poetry . . . literally bringing never before ideas and forms to life . . . and yet, spending your days convinced that there is nothing interesting to do, so we better just watch another video, or scroll another social media page.\nIt’s crazy really.\nGeorge proposes a mindset shift to counter this dangerous form of boredom.\nIt’s not that we are born to be bored with life - or uninspired by our own soul. Rather, it is that we have just allowed ourselves to be distracted. And if we instead approached every single thing in our experience with a child’s outlook - or, as Zen practitioners call it “The Beginners Mind” . . . I guarantee the entire world around us would immediately transform.\nThis is something I often think about when taking photos - where I’m usually trying to find beauty in the simplest corners of nature, rather than in expansive vistas.\nGeorge then provides detailed instructions on how to practice this now.\nSo, go find a flower, or a leaf, or any object you so choose - and just imagine this is the very first time you are ever seeing it.\nThe colour. . . the scent . . . the petals - the lines on it’s surface - the touch of it’s body.\nPut aside everything you have ever learned about it’s name or it’s scientific classification . . . and just observe it as if you are a complete stranger in this world.\nJust reading this reminded me of the note I just wrote, which I mentioned above. When being at a presence of anything (or, perhaps, even anyone), experience should come before explanation, and explanation should only be offered when asked or when very necessary.\nI read this a few minutes before the golden hour. When the hour arrived, I took my camera and followed the light. I didn’t walk towards my favorite trails. I stayed at home, walked around the yard, and looked for the “simplest corners of nature.” The light did not fail me.\nThis week’s walk ends here. For any feedback, please reply to the email or comment on the post. Thank you. I am happy that you are here.\n","date":"23 October 2022","permalink":"/tlw/007/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Our Invisible Walden"},{"content":" Exultation is the going Of an inland soul to sea, Past the houses — past the headlands — Into deep eternity —\n— Emily Dickinson\nWelcome back, fellow saunterer.

These footprints serve as archetypes for anyone in their own independent philosophical and contemplative journey.\nFor many of you, this is our second week walking together. The outdoors is waiting. There is a lot to cover. So wear your best footwear and bring some water. Let us begin to follow the footprints of the previous week\u0026rsquo;s walk.\nThe Long Walk: October 10 to 15, 2022 #October 10, Monday #Have I told you about [[henry bugbee]]? Oh, you must know about Henry Bugbee. We both share a love of [[henry david thoreau]], and among all the candidates for being Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s heir, I think he is the closest, at least in terms of resonance. [[annie dillard]] could be the closest modern Thoreau in terms of writing style (she\u0026rsquo;s the only one I\u0026rsquo;ve read who could really pull it off!). But Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s life is closer to Thoreau, and for me, that is more important.\nBugbee, like Thoreau, was committed to a philosophical-spiritual life. He is a \u0026ldquo;professional philosopher\u0026rdquo; trained in the academe (unlike Thoreau, who was largely self-taught). And yet he saw philosophy like Thoreau did. To him, philosophy was not an impersonal discipline preoccupied with arguments and opinions. He saw philosophy as an exploration of his life in the context of other lives and sentient beings in nature.\nLiving philosophically to him took prior importance over professional success, and because of that, he was denied tenure at Harvard. His philosophical life rejected the publish-or-perish aphorism of the academe. He refused to write strictly academic essays and was never interested in treating his writing like a conveyor belt, a model that most of his peers followed. In fact, this is an area where he clearly surpassed Thoreau. If Thoreau published very little (just two books and a few works published posthumously), Bugbee almost published nothing. His only book was [[the inward morning bugbee|The Inward Morning]], a relatively obscure book that presents Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s philosophical thoughts in journal form. What did he do when he was not writing? Well, living, of course.\nFor the past two months or so, I have been reading The Inward Morning intermittently, writing my summary with a few commentaries for each entry. The Inward Morning is not the easiest book to read and so I tried my best to translate Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s thoughts in a more palatable form in my commentaries.\nIn his entry, dated September 27, 1952 (the entry I read on this day), Bugbee meditated on the role of faith in philosophical reflection. Here is a sample of my commentary on this entry:\nIn this entry, Henry Bugbee directly responds to [[Gabriel Marcel]]. He returns to the subject of [[faith]]. He begins by stating that faith (i.e., openness or trustingness) is as important in ethical reflection as in action. Philosophical truth, he claims, arrives to the present from the past via reflection. But this arrival requires faith on the possibility of realization because philosophical truth, the meaning of one\u0026rsquo;s past experiences, comes involuntarily like insight ([[insight cannot be predetermined]]). We do not control its arrival artificially. We can only wait and trust (i.e., have faith) that it will arrive.\n[[The Inward Morning Commentary 1952-09-27|Read the entire entry here]].\nOctober 11, Tuesday #I continued reading The Inward Morning. In his entry written on September 28, 1952, Bugbee presented a critique of the statement \u0026ldquo;believe in order to understand.\u0026rdquo; He says that this statement invites dishonesty as it presupposes that we can believe in something we do not understand. He seems to suggest that belief cannot be used to achieve something (i.e., understanding). If anything, belief or faith is a place where we arrive, not a vehicle we use to arrive at something. After understanding everything and noticing that our knowledge can only get us to a point, we call upon faith. Faith is surrendering to mystery.\nThis entry is the most difficult to understand among all the entries I’ve read so far and I won\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if my interpretation was wrong. Also, I honestly felt a little uncomfortable reading about faith among other of Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s choice of topics. Faith is a topic I have avoided ever since leaving my childhood religion and contemplating it brings up difficult memories. That said, as I grow into my philosophical walk, I see that there are philosophical questions we will never truly answer and an important task of anyone who is called to nurture a friendship with wisdom is to acknowledge this the soonest. Such humility will save one from heartache and will guide one into finding the mysteries that truly exist. I think faith is inevitable.\nIn the evening, I walked among the large palm trees at UPLB. I wrote these words on my digital note-taking app:\nI fancy these large trees. When I see them together like standing giants. I feel in awe. Astounded. Like silent watchers of the paths.\nOctober 12, Wednesday #Hoping to establish some continuity in my days, I persevered into reading The Inward Morning. Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s September 29 entry was about what is essential to a person\u0026rsquo;s life. He mentioned in a previous entry that the realization of what is essential to us comes unexpectedly, usually in the middle of our normal routines. What is essential to one human, therefore, is subjective, as it may not be what is essential to another.\nHere lies a problem: how is sympathy possible in a world where people have different and often conflicting essentials? Bugbee says that our ability to know what is essential to us also means we have the ability to perceive what is essential to others. This opens the door to sympathy. He further claims that a universal need—the need to commune with others—is enough to establish the foundation for fellow feeling.\nThe rest of his entry is a thought-provoking meditation on the relationship between the individual and the collective, one of my favorite philosophical problems. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quote from Bugbee himself:\nPerhaps we are only truly individual in so far as we are able to acknowledge and act upon a universal significance in our lives which is the very opposite of divisive in its import for our relations with other persons.\nThis reminds me of [[scott barry kaufman]]’s insight in his book [[transcend kaufman]]: We self-actualize so that we eventually transcend, a state where we forget ourselves and our communion with the interconnectedness of everything and everyone takes center stage.\nIn the afternoon, I re-read my past nature journal entries, entries I wrote when I tried emulating Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s writing routine. His routine went this way:\nHe took long walks in the afternoon, possibly right after lunch until early evening (sometimes later). He wrote brief notes about what he noticed around him while he walked. The following morning, he would go back to his notes and expand them into journal entries. He repeated this from 1850 until he died in 1861 (a total of 11 years). I was only able to sustain this routine for a couple of weeks. I was not my hero, but it was a great experiment, and reading those entries now makes me realize I actually enjoyed those days a lot. Expanding the entries was difficult, yes, but the method really elevates the quality of the day and aids a lot in reflection. I go back and reread those entries now and I see each day as clearly as when I experienced them. With that clarity comes the opportunity to extract some useful truth from them.\nHere are two of my best entries:\n[[2020-10-08 seeds]] [[thoughts/2020-10-10 seeds]] [[2020-10-15 seeds]] [[2020-10-18 seeds]] [[2020-10-19 seeds]] Inspired by reading my past nature journal entries, I tried writing brief notes of observations during my walk that evening: [[2022-10-12 seeds]].\nOctober 13, Thursday #Curious to see if I could improve the quality of my walks, I decided to try a morning walk for a change. I left the house at around 7:30, which, I discovered, provides one of the best lights you will ever catch in Los Baños, so I took a few photos while on the walk, something I haven\u0026rsquo;t done for a while.\nI stopped on a bench for a while to enjoy the cold breeze that blew from behind me. After a few minutes, I continued walking until I reached the Fertility Tree at Freedom Park (the featured photo for this newsletter). Under the tree, I journaled about how this morning\u0026rsquo;s walk made me feel at home in Los Baños again. I wrote that perhaps it is not a change of location that I need but a change of routine. I also continued reading The Inward Morning and wrote my commentary on Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s October 2, 1952, entry. In this entry, Bugbee talks about Socrates and how the power of his thought lies not in his induction but in the ability of his inquiry to return us to ourselves. Bugbee also commented on Socrates’ idea of the examined life and its value. You can read my entire commentary on the website.\nAs if I needed more walking, my partner and I walked in the evening, under a bright moon after the new stray cat we adopted was spayed. We sat on one of the benches at Freedom Park. What ensued was her sharing of a podcast show she was currently listening to about a couple who left Christianity. This is my partner\u0026rsquo;s current process, which is something I went through in 2012 (more than a decade now!). Listening to her made me realize how much trauma we could carry just by being brought up in a religious household. A question revisited me: Is the parent\u0026rsquo;s role to mold the child to be who she wants him to be or to support the child to become who he wants to be?\nOctober 14, Friday #In the previous issue, I shared that I am currently reading the book [[living philosophy mooney|Living Philosphy in Kierkegaard, Melville, and Others]] by [[edward mooney]]. Mooney is a student of Henry Bugbee, and I am currently reading him as the focal point from where I shall trace my philosophical family tree.\nThe book is a delightful collection of essays, relatively short in length, poetically delivered, and yet philosophical in the subject. I love this word Mooney uses—living philosophy. Here\u0026rsquo;s how he defines it:\n“Living Philosophy” in my title has a double sense. We have philosophy that’s conveyed as a dramatic living narrative. And second, we have a spectrum of persons who in various ways are living out their philosophies.\nI am realizing these days that, while I think analytic philosophy is extremely important and necessary, my talents fit a brand of philosophy that is closer to the arts than the sciiences. A living philosophy—this is what I am intent in studying more about.\nOctober 15, Saturday #This entire day, I did a mind walk on the life and works of the poet [[rofel brion]].\nIn the Philippines, poetry that feels good, the kind that primarily speaks to that speechless, inarticulate part of us, is very rare. It has almost no advocates in the academe, and that is why we are so lucky to have someone alive and still kicking to serve as a beacon of this way of writing poetry who is as embedded in the academe as he is outside.\nI knew Rofel Brion through my friend who first discovered his book at a book fair and who has since talked to him via Zoom. I connected to Rofel through Facebook and luckily got an invite for the launch of his new book of vignettes called Saglit: Alaala’t Muni, which happened today.\nTo prepare for the launch, I re-listened to his podcast interview with Kevin Chan. If you have a single link to click in this newsletter (and you also write poetry), this should be it. Rofel\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of \u0026ldquo;not taking your writing seriously\u0026rdquo; is a refreshing and much-needed perspective in a world that valorizes creative production. It frees me as it resonates well with the things I am learning about writing from Bugbee and Thoreau.\nTo experiment with a Rofelian style of poetry (what he calls \u0026ldquo;mala-haiku\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;haiku-like\u0026rdquo;), I wrote a poem, which I translated into Filipino. A friend, GP Roperos, then translated it into Spanish. Here is the poem in three languages:\nRESTS\nI long for the moments when you sprawl beside me and I stroke the white fur of your belly as you purr in delight.\nMGA PAHINGA\nInaasam ko ang mga sandaling humihilata ka sa tabi ko at hinahaplos ko ang puting balahibo ng tiyan mo habang humuhuni ka sa galak.\nDESCANSOS\nSiempre deseo que te acuestes al lado de mi y tocaria el pelo blanco de tu vientre mientras ronronearias con gran deleite.\nI went home that night, with Rofel’s new book in my bag and a handful of new seeds of thoughts to write about in the following days.\nHere is a distinguished poet whose main audience, after himself, was his family, friends, and people he has touched in his life. Rofel writes about and for people whose faces he knows and whose names he can recall. (Listen to the podcast interview I beg you, and discover a new way of doing art.)\nI went home that night—and I remembered you, you who are reading this newsletter right now. All of you. Some, I know by name. Some, I know their faces. But about half are still faceless strangers. I asked myself, what can we do to change that?\nWell, of course, to ask you to introduce yourself.\nBefore You Go #I want to know your name, where you are from, and what you do these days. What philosophical or contemplative interests do you have? Please reply to this email or comment on the public post. And if there is anything that resonated with you from this week’s walk—or any feedback—please don’t hesitate to share them. I will read and respond to everything. I am happy you are here.\n","date":"16 October 2022","permalink":"/tlw/006/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"The Inward Morning"},{"content":" \u0026ldquo;In making the journey, I have no aims.

Please bring your shoes in. I don’t mind. And sit here beside me. Would you like some brewed coffee? Or perhaps some sweet ternate tea?\nWelcome, welcome, and thank you for coming by. It is an honor to have you here even for a few minutes—a privilege to host you on my little space on the web. Please come and take your rest.\nI am Vince, and this little abode of ours is The Long Walk, a new newsletter I hope to welcome you to every Sunday from now. Since it is probably our first time to meet (or we have met long ago and forgotten each other’s stories), please allow me some introduction.\nMy Long Walk So Far #I wrote a longer piece of my story on my website, so I won’t bore you with the details here. But to provide some context, here’s a brief timeline of my long walk so far.\n1992–2011: I grew up in a small town in Pangasinan, Philippines. Raised by Jehovah’s Witnesses, I had a pretty religious upbringing. I didn’t fully embrace the faith of my parents, though, until I got into college when I became the youngest pastor (they call it “ministerial servant”) in our congregation at the age of 18. A month after I turned 19, I went through a debilitating depressive episode. I left school, went back home, and licked my wounds. 2012–2014: The depression crushed my entire identity and belief system. I left my childhood religion and returned to school to finish my degree. I became an atheist. 2015–2016: While I identified as an atheist, I never fully embraced that identity. I discovered blogging and encountered a writer who made me realize that I still resonated with what most people describe as “spiritual.” I started exploring Eastern philosophy (read the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali!) and attended New Age gatherings. I still didn’t believe in “God,” but I knew I had “spiritual” sensibilities. 2017–present: I discovered philosophy. I dropped the New Age stuff but kept the Eastern philosophical ideas. Never wanting to go back to school, I taught myself the basics. I was first obsessed with metaphysics (what exists) and epistemology (how we know what we know), but later realized I was more interested in answering the question, “How should I live?” Around the same time, I discovered poetry, photography, and the power of walking. Plus, I was able to keep daily journaling, reading, and studying routines. So I thought, why not combine everything into a single lifelong learning project? And so, The Long Walk was born. A Note on Format #For now, this newsletter’s structure shall follow the rhythms of a walk. A walk leaves footprints and makes trails. Those who follow the walk must find the first footprint and begin there until the destination is reached. The tracks left allow us to “reenact” the walk. Interestingly, this is precisely what a poem or a narrative does. In a reading companion to a collection of his essays and poems, Thomas Gardner has this to say about narrative and poetry:\nWallace Stevens, in “Of Modern Poetry” (1940), defines a poem as “the mind in the act of finding / What will suffice.” This seems to me to be true of any work organized lyrically: poems, certain sorts of essays, certain sorts of fiction. We see in such work a mind moving—noting and considering, listening to what it has just said, leaping forward or turning back. Rather than reporting on what will suffice, speaking from a position of arrival, this kind of writing dramatizes the act of getting there. What we do when we read such work, as Kenneth Burke illustrates …, is reenact that movement. We perform the poem, connecting image to image or turn to turn, making of its various parts a coherent inner action: “For a poem is an act, the symbolic act of the poet who made it—an act of such a nature that, in surviving as a structure or an affect, it enables us as readers to re-enact it.”\nA poem, we might say, gives us instructions for re-enacting its inner movements.\nAnd so, through this newsletter, I will attempt to lay down the trails of my mind—some of the things I read, saw, heard, felt, or thought about in a week. I present them here as footprints, therefore, in chronological order.\nSince this newsletter comes out every Sunday, the chronology happens from Monday to Saturday. I do not impose a pre-existing structure on the piece. I let the structure emerge as I look back to the week. This structure hunting happens on the day the newsletter comes out: Sunday. If the structure appears, I will be grateful. If it does not, I surrender to what is given to me. As often happens in a real walk, we cannot control what we see or find. We can only control where we put our attention into. If the essay does not look well-organized, please remember that this was by design. The goal of the newsletter is to leave footprints, not blueprints.\nThe purpose of The Long Walk is to invite you, dear fellow traveler, to take a peek into an intellectual and contemplative life outside the academe or a formal religious institution. But I also ask you to engage and start a conversation—you can do so in public via the comments section or in private by responding through email.\nSince this is our first walk together, a preamble is necessary, making this first issue longer than I intend to be its usual length. I promise I won’t keep you this long in our next walks together.\nWith all that out of the way, please, I invite you to stand up and join me outside. Let us go under the trees and the warm rays of the sun for a little stroll down the trails of the previous week’s walk.\nThe Long Walk: October 3 to 8, 2022 #October 3, Monday #While exploring Substack, the platform where you are currently reading The Long Walk, I subscribed to a few other newsletters. I read one entitled Weary and Sated With Seeing: Lucretius and Us. The central thesis of the piece is that our minds are attracted to what is new rather than what truly matters. Here’s my favorite quote from the article:\nNo one prides themselves on knowing that the sky appears blue, but we do pride ourselves on more exotic types of knowledge.\nOctober 4, Tuesday # I reread Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon while writing notes in my journal by hand. I came to this quote at the end, which got me thinking:\n\u0026ldquo;What makes us interesting isn\u0026rsquo;t just what we\u0026rsquo;ve experienced, but also what we haven\u0026rsquo;t experienced.\u0026rdquo;\nI looked for an example from my life, and one thing came to mind. Growing up, I didn’t have the experience of living in a house where people asked each other what they were doing. All of us were silent types, and we did our own thing in the privacy of our rooms. What this did to me was I flourished on my own. I didn’t need much validation. Almost everything I did then (even now) was for the intrinsic reward I get from it.\nIn the evening, I listened to Sam Harris’ interview with the poet David Whyte on the Making Sense podcast. In the interview, Sam alluded to the assumption that meditation requires silence or the absence of words or thoughts. We both agree that it doesn’t. It is impossible to be conscious and without thoughts at the same time. As long as you are aware, you produce thoughts. Meditation is not silence or nonthinking. Meditation is simply a careful discipline of paying attention. We can do it both in silence or in the middle of a conversation, for one’s object of meditation can be anything.\nOctober 5, Wednesday #I did a morning walk with my partner, which I now find more regenerative than the late afternoon to early evening walks that I typically do. Now that students are back in Los Baños, the university has been filled with people in the afternoon, and my afternoon walks are beginning to lose their magic. I need to do more morning walks.\nWhile walking, I asked my partner about that quote from Steal Like an Artist, which I mentioned above. From listening to her thoughts, I came to a new conclusion: We are hindered by our lack of experiences, and yet, like any disability, we can turn this incapacitation into something that makes us unique.\nBack home, I sat down to ask myself, “How does one start living a philosophical and contemplative life?” This is a question I wanted to introduce early in this newsletter and the reason why I reread Steal Like an Artist in the first place. Kleon’s answer to art can also be adopted in philosophy: You don’t have to recreate the wheel. Thousands of ordinary people like you have attempted the same feat. Look for their examples and steal from them.\nI wanted to look for heroes—mentors, alive or dead—and learn from them one by one as much as I could. I needed to create a philosophical genealogy. I began my search for heroes by returning to a kind of philosophy I encountered a few months ago: Lyric philosophy.\nI read Introduction: What is Lyric Philosophy? by Warren Heiti, which talks about Jan Zwicky’s seminal book, Lyric Philosophy. I learned about the interesting design of Zwicky’s book, which she seemed to have replicated in at least one of her subsequent books. I also learned that “lyric philosophy” is a more accepted term with a decent amount of following in the academe compared to Edward Mooney’s “lyrical philosophy.” That said, both scholars find inspiration from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.\nMy philosophical family tree so far October 6, Thursday #Jan Zwicky is part of my philosophical genealogy, but should I start my studies with her? I was not sure. I felt like she spent most of her work talking about form rather than answering the central question I wanted to contemplate: “How should I live?”\nI decided to start with someone else first: Edward Mooney. I began by reading his blog, Mists on the Rivers. In his blog, Ed mentions his heroes—Thoreau, Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard, and Bashō. Thoreau was already in my family tree. I happily added the others. Ed also pointed me to two other blogs worth studying: Distinctly Praise the Years and Quantum Est In Rebus Inane, which in English means, “How much trivial stuff there is in the world!”\nIn the evening, I dedicated a walk to a friend who died in a terrible vehicular accident a few years back. She once studied at UPLB and, for sure, walked some of the places I frequent on campus. A poem honoring her came to me while crossing the never-ending bridge of lore. You can read that poem on the website.\nOctober 7, Friday #In my journal, I alluded to how translation facilitates understanding by forcing us to read something slowly. Although I love Thoreau, I find Walden, especially its first chapter, difficult to swallow. That changed when I decided to start translating it into Filipino. The translation process forces you to look at each sentence and word as closely as possible. Only then can you understand what you are reading and internalize it better because it is in your language. It doesn’t work all the time, but it will work for most of us.\nBack on Edward Mooney’s blog, I read Sympathy with Intelligence, which touched me deeply. He writes so well that I started reading his latest book Living Philosophy in Kierkegaard, Melville, and Others.\nOctober 8, Saturday #As we often do on the weekends, my partner and I walked from our house to the School of Forestry at UPLB, a length which is enough to cover in about 45 minutes of leisurely walking. We do it in the morning right after we wake up. Upon arrival, we usually look for an empty cottage under the big trees and start meditating. This time, we tried something different. We looked for a single prompt, which each of us used to journal for one to three pages worth of writing. The prompt that came to us was the verb “articulating.” We read our essays to each other after. You can read mine on the website.\nThis ends our walk for this week. Thank you for joining me, and I hope to see you again next Sunday!\nReferences #I cultivate a forest garden of the mind, which I call my collection of notes from almost a decade of reading, writing, and contemplation. Here are the notes from where this week’s newsletter came from.\n[[Poetry and narrative trace their history so readers can re-enact them]] [[steal like an artist - kleon]] [[Meditation does not require silence or nonthinking]] [[lyric philosophy]] ","date":"9 October 2022","permalink":"/tlw/005/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"A Philosophical Family Tree"},{"content":"Uman is a monthly newsletter about documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.\nIn this August 2022 issue:\nHenry Bugbee and his philosophy of place, presence, and memory Leaving academia Andrew J.

I started it by experimenting with work schedule. I combined two working-for-money sessions that ran from July 26 to August 6. Usually, I would work four to five straight 12+ hour work days during the last five days of each month. This frees up the next 25 days of the following month for philosophy, walking, and photography. I wrote about how I got into this lifestyle in a badly titled essay I wrote a few years back: \u0026ldquo;How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite.\u0026rdquo;\nI was curious what would working for ten straight 12+ hour work days in exchange for 50 free soulful days felt like, so I tried. I might never do it again. After 120+ work hours in a span of ten days, I went home immediately to Pangasinan to spend time with some relatives coming home from the States for the first time since the pandemic. There, in between family bonding, I spent my time exploring a few new thinkers and a completely different way of writing and publishing online, which I have been exposed to in the past but never really embraced until now: digital gardening.\nPhilosophical and other studies #Henry Bugbee #I discovered Henry Bugbee through his prolific student Edward Mooney, while reading about Henry David Thoreau last month. The two Henries were similar as they both wrote works that could be classified as lyrical philosophy, that is, philosophical texts that were written sans the rigid and dry language of most analytical philosophy but instead using literary techniques like narrative and verse. They are called lyrical because the use of the first person \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; is integral in this kind of philosophy. The experiences and point of view of the author is seminal in the work. It is a kind of philosophy I am playing around in the past couple of months. In fact, I already have some ideas on how to explore lyrical philosophy in my work. Specifically, I would like to combine analytical and lyrical philosophy in one practice.\nBugbee, like Thoreau, wrote relatively little and published even less. In fact, while Thoreau only published two books, Bugbee only published one—The Inward Morning: A Philosophical Exploration in Journal Form. It is a beautiful piece of writing, one that eludes simple description. I have only started to read its first 50 pages but I have to say it is a mix of deep, difficult prose and poetic, even entertaining stories. Lyrical, indeed. If you are curious, I started publishing my commentaries on The Inward Morning by Bugbee.\nSince he is not a structured thinker, Bugbee can be difficult to understand. To help me \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; him, I read two excellent essays: \u0026ldquo;Henry Bugbee: Thinker, Wanderer, Fly-fisherman\u0026rdquo; by Joseph Keegin and Working Certainty and Deweyan Wisdom by Douglas Anderson. The introduction of his book written by his mentor Gabriel Marcel also helped as well as a podcast about his essay \u0026ldquo;Education and the Style of Our Lives.\u0026rdquo;\nBugbee believes that philosophy, like poetry, should flow, and therefore, the philospher should follow a poetic principle in writing:\nGet it down. Get down so far as possible the minute inflections of day to day thought. Get down the key ideas as they occur. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about what it will add up to. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about whether it will come to something finished. Don\u0026rsquo;t give it up when faced with the evidence of miscarried thought. Write on, not over again. Let it flow. Don\u0026rsquo;t haggle with the naturalists. Don\u0026rsquo;t be stopping to jam the idea down somebody\u0026rsquo;s throat. Give it a chance. If there can be concrete philosophy, give it a chance. Let one perception move instantly on another. Where they come from is to be trusted. Unless this is so, after all is said and done, philosophy is arbitrary and idle.\nHis epistemology inspired me to treat the field notes I write during my walks and the fleeting notes I take while reading as integral parts of my philosophical universe. Before, I treated them as inputs to be processed and later on deleted. This August, I created a separate tag in my Obsidian vault that marked them as \u0026ldquo;seeds\u0026rdquo;—seeds that need planting somewhere in my forest garden of the mind.\nHere are two seeds I was particularly fond of in August—both of them taken during a walk:\n2022-08-09 seeds 2022-08-18 seeds Leaving academia #I have always been interested in intellectual work happening outside academia. In August, I found some resources about people who were once deep inside academia and now were out.

Brown and unitarianism #While looking for secondary resources to help me understand Henry Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s The Inward Morning, I came across an article entitled Henry Bugbee - an atheistic mysticism free of mythological trappings. It was an article posted on a very interesting website. Interesting because it was owned (and regularly updated!) by a church minister who was also an atheist! To show you how interesting this person is, I\u0026rsquo;ll just paste his bio here:\nMy name is Andrew James Brown. I’m a philosophically/theologically inclined writer with sympathies towards Christian atheism, D. G. Leahy’s “thinking now occurring for the first time”, a Lucretian inspired religious naturalism, new materialism and Kyoto School philosophy; also a photographer, cyclist, walker and jazz bass player. In addition to this, I’m the minister of a small, liberal-religious, free-thinking community in Cambridge (UK).\nHe got me at \u0026ldquo;philosophically/theologically inclined writer\u0026rdquo; (That\u0026rsquo;s me! Well, at least the first half of it) but also at Christian atheism (I had no idea something like that existed). I read Andrew\u0026rsquo;s About page and fell in love with the twist and turns of his life that led him to where he is now. He piqued my interest on the philosopher Benedict Spinoza and I just love this quote he uses throughout his work, a quote by the philosopher Herbert Fingarette:\n\u0026ldquo;These studies are outcomes rather than realised objectives. In making the journey, I have no aims. These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints.\u0026rdquo;\nThat\u0026rsquo;s exactly how I want my thinking and writing to look like or, at least, try to be. His article/sermon \u0026ldquo;The Freedom To Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today\u0026rdquo; elaborated this quote.\nAfter reading the word unitarianism from Andrew\u0026rsquo;s bio, I immediately felt it was familiar. Ah, yes! The movie Come Sunday, which was about the excommunication of Carlton Pearson, a once pastor of the Higher Dimensions Family Church, because of his refusal to teach the existence of hell. After leaving his previous church, Pearson became affiliated with a unitarian church.\nUnitarianism, I would later learn, is one of the most liberal movements in religion, one that allowed its ministers to teach free thinking theologies, even skepticism about the existence of God. As an ex-young pastor of a fundamentalist evangelical religion, who left after realizing how stringent the rules in the church were, the spirit of unitarianism speaks a lot to me. Although I have no plans of joining any organize religion anytime soon, Andrew\u0026rsquo;s work reminded me of the many possibilities in a life devoted to philosophy and contemplation.\nReligion and spirituality #Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s only book The Inward Morning was described by Gabriel Marcel as a religious work. Fifty pages past since I started reading it, nothing in there came to me as religious except, perhaps, some alusions to Eastern philosophy. Was this what Marcel referred to as \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo;? This got me thinking: How do philosophers use the noun \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; and its adjective \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo;? In addition, Andrew Brown mentioned religious naturalism in his bio, which I immediately checked out. I read the Wikipedia entry on it. I discovered that religious naturalism is a relatively new belief system that simply introduces religious practices, ideas, and values as a response to a sense of wonder of the natural world. Many atheists or agnostics who reject the supernatural realm but are still \u0026ldquo;religious\u0026rdquo; find a home in this label. To learn more about this perspective, I listened to a podcast interview of one of the movement\u0026rsquo;s founders, Ursula Goodenough.\nAll of these led me to a rabbit hole that I should have explored long ago if I have not been intentionally avoiding the topic: religion. After I left my childhood religion, I found that it was an almost automatic reflex to reject anything that has to do with \u0026ldquo;religion.\u0026rdquo; Although I did have a [[The Eastern philosophy period of my intellectual life (2015–2017)|\u0026ldquo;spiritual period\u0026rdquo;]] a few years after leaving the church when I explored different Eastern belief systems, I never really was able to let go of the cautiousness I learned from my previous experience nor do I want to let go of it. Today, as I try to develop my own worldview, I never really looked at the current project as something \u0026ldquo;religious.\u0026rdquo; But reading Bugbee and encountering religious naturalism convinced me that I need to understand what religion really is and evaluate my life work through that understanding.\nI started my exploration by reading the entry entitled \u0026ldquo;The Concept of Religion\u0026rdquo; at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I was mindblown by the plethora of options in defining religion, many of which I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of. I assumed that the word religion always referred to an organized group that shared a belief in a deity or deities and whose practices and traditions involved pleasing those dieties. But the original meaning of the Greek word religio was far from this assumption and even more contemporary definitions reject the idea that a religion always requires a belief in a deity. If you are fascinated by this topic, like me, you can check out the notes I wrote about the theme [[religion]].\nAfter reading and thinking about the many uses of the word religion, I began thinking about the possibility of having a religious element in my life work. As I have articulated in the past, I see my life work as something that revolves around finding answers to the question [[how to live]]. My desire to learn phiosophy and develop [[my worldview]] and a unique way of life based on that is, I now see, a very religious endeavor. In history, such an endeavor was originally philosophical (that is, it didn\u0026rsquo;t involve deities), but it was later adopted by religious people throughout history that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep a blind eye to the lives of these great exemplars. They are rich resources for my project.\nI am taking baby steps towards this direction. I wrote the following notes where I considered the possibility of learning from my past life as a religious person:\n[[Things I had in my past religious life I can incorporate in my current life]] [[A comparison of my past religious life and my life today]] Thinking about religion, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t not think about [[spirituality]]. Not long from my research, I realized that, unlike religion, most resources about the meaning of he word spirituality are written outside academic circles by spiritual gurus from different traditions. Scholars treat spirituality as something integral to religious studies and, therefore, does not give it its own discourse. That is starting to change as some philosophers are advocating for the establishent of a new \u0026ldquo;philosophy of spirituality.\u0026rdquo; As currently conceptualized, spirituality seems to be closer to the concept of a \u0026ldquo;personal religion,\u0026rdquo; a religion that is curated by the individual practitioner using different elements from different traditions available in a \u0026ldquo;spritual marketplace.\u0026rdquo; Also, spirituality, as understood by psychologists, refers to the state of having spiritual experiences (or transcendental experiences), something that [[Scott Barry Kaufman]] discusses in his book [[transcend kaufman|Transcend]].\nA seed note I wrote recently (2022-08-30 seeds) captures my current thinking and dilemmas about the words \u0026ldquo;religion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;spirituality.\u0026rdquo; My current stand is to avoid using these words in my life work, at least for now, not because they are innacurate (my work indeed has a religious and spiritual element), but because they are too loaded that I might be misinterpreted. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear alternative. But for now, I will stick to philosophy or \u0026ldquo;way of life\u0026rdquo; as labels to my project.\nWriting #I wrote a new Lilim issue earlier last month: \u0026ldquo;Lilim 032 — Walking Lopez, Quezon Part II: A Fishpond at San Jose\u0026rdquo;.\nIn my digital forest garden, I also published first drafts of four vignettes:\n[[sa harap ng lawa ng sampaloc]] [[the ube halaya stores at san pablo]] [[ang mosque sa bulusan street]] [[the dirt roads are my kissas]] These drafts could become future Lilim issues. Why I am publishing \u0026ldquo;drafts\u0026rdquo; will be explained in the next section.\nLastly, I wrote a lengthy Facebook post about why [[freelancing or entrepreneurship is more financially secure]]. A lot of my freelancer and entrepreneur friends seem to resonate with it.\nProjects #Digital Gardening #As I said in the introduction, I spent a good amount of August thinking about and applying a different way of writing on the web. Earlier this year, I intended to learn web design and development. I took a course (which I haven\u0026rsquo;t finished yet!). My goal was to redesign my website from the ground up. I also wanted to launch a customized website for the hundreds of processed and unprocessed notes in my [[personal knowledge management]] system, notes I accumulated from years of reading, writing, and reflecting.\nWhile researching for inspirations for the redesign, I cam across the website 100r.co. Its authors treated the website as a personal wiki (an encyclopedia of their life while living in a boat and experimenting with a low-tech lifestyle). I became fascinated by the concept and wanted to turn my website into something similar, to distance myself from the time-bound chronological style of maintaining a site that also pressures one to produce and publish. Alas, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the coding skills to create one. I just learned how to use Hugo, a static site generator, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t verse in the languages of coding: HTML, CSS, or JS. Because of this, I settled to old-school blogging, parked the project, and focused on my other interests like photography.\nToday, I understand that what I really wanted was to combine both my notes and my blog posts into a single ecosystem where my writings are treated as different stages in a plant\u0026rsquo;s life: [[seeds]], [[seedlings]], and [[evergreens]]. This, I later learned, was connected to the idea of digital gardening.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t implement this system early this year because, aside from my mediocre coding know-how, my notes and blog posts were in a form that cannot be uploaded into a static site. This was the reason why I switched from Craft to Obsidian in curating my notes. All my notes and blog posts are now in markdown, a file type that could be uploade into the web via a static site generator like Hugo. Using a really amazing theme, Quartz, that is what I did.\nToday, I publish my Obsidian vault, with both my blog posts and notes, into a single site: vinceimbat.com. Things aren\u0026rsquo;t perfect. I am still using a theme. I still don\u0026rsquo;t know how to fully customize it to suite my own needs. But I am happy with how the website turned out for now.\nIf you want to know more about this project, I documented it through a log here: [[Project log - Forest garden publishing]]. Also, here is a note introducing my initial thoughts about using a \u0026ldquo;forest garden\u0026rdquo; as a metaphor to refer to my writing and thinking ecosystem: [[forest garden of the mind]].\n","date":"3 September 2022","permalink":"/uman/008/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 008 — August 2022"},{"content":" On the morning of July 4, 2022, I walked with my mother and father from our house at Cablong, Sta. Barbara, to a relative\u0026rsquo;s house at nearby Botao. It was a rare occasion. I was already living 170 miles away from them and was only staying for about a week. Before relocating to Los Baños, we no longer walked together, something we used to do around 2011 when I was recovering from depression.\nHowever, my mother almost lost her eyesight from diabetes and was prescribed a strict exercise regimen. Meanwhile, my father had his own existential encounter with mortality due to my mother\u0026rsquo;s recent health debacle and decided to follow suit. As for me, I missed my parents, so I took the chance to walk with them once more after a long, long time.\nEn route to Botao, we decided to use the Balon Dalan road. It was my father who suggested it, saying we might finally see Sabel, the Deaf woman who took care of me when I was a year old and whom I\u0026rsquo;ve never met since.\nMy sister was just a year old when I was born. My father traveled a lot as part of his job, so my mother needed extra help. They said it was very difficult to find a helper at that time, so when someone recommended a young unmarried lady from Sta. Barbara, my mother readily accepted even when the lady couldn\u0026rsquo;t talk.\nWhenever my mother tells stories about Sabel, she would always premise it with, \u0026ldquo;She loved you so much.\u0026rdquo; She would mention that time when I was sleeping in my crib and my one-year-old sister would play around me, making loud noises. She said Sabel would get mad at her and would unwaveringly defend me throwing random angry sounds at my sister, which my mother would hear from upstairs. My sister, who already knew a few words, would retaliate, calling Sabel \u0026ldquo;pangit\u0026rdquo; (ugly), which, fortunately, she didn\u0026rsquo;t hear.\nBut then, my mother would also blame her for why I started talking very late. She would mention the large cross she hung in her room (my parents are Jehovah\u0026rsquo;s Witnesses). Then she would always end with, \u0026ldquo;Oh, and she was larcenous!\u0026rdquo;\nWhen my mother asked her to leave because she was getting sicker and sicker with weak lungs, my mother said Sabel hugged me tightly and kissed me goodbye like a real mother would do to her child.\nI was fond of all these stories, but what baffled me the most was the thought of what it would have been like to feel all that gesture of affection from this stranger. I hold a grudge against the universe for giving me all that love at a time when I was unable to register it in my brain and remember. Sometimes, I ask whether it was easier to show love to a stranger when he is but a helpless infant. And so, you can say, I was really looking forward to this occasion—to finally meet Sabel.\nWe entered an open gate to a compound of two or three houses. There was a kubo in front of a bungalow with a patio typical of houses in Pangasinan. My father immediately recognized a man sitting in the kubo. \u0026ldquo;Is Sabel here?\u0026rdquo; my father asked him. \u0026ldquo;The child he took care of is here,\u0026rdquo; he continued. The man stood up smiling. \u0026ldquo;Call your Tita Sabel,\u0026rdquo; he told an eavesdropping teenage girl. The girl went off at the back of the house and we waited for a few minutes. When she came back, behind her was the woman in my mother\u0026rsquo;s stories.\nShe has grown old. Who knows how many other children she took care of after me. But underneath the white hair and the wrinkles on her face was a genuine smile I would always fail to describe. She hugged me and then held my right arm staying close to me as much as possible. She was giggling, making signs in the air about how tall I had grown. We were both excited to see each other.\nI remembered all the years that had to pass before this little reunion—30 years—a reunion that would\u0026rsquo;ve been different had it not been for the language barrier. She is Deaf but isn\u0026rsquo;t versed in sign language, which I was proficient in, having been an ex-minister to the Deaf. I would\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to ask her questions, to get to know her, to have a glimpse of what her life was like during all those 30 years that passed. But I tried to ask her in natural sign language whether she got married or had her own child and she didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to understand any of the signs. The man who asked the girl to call her said she never got married.\nWe continued walking that morning, leaving Tita Sabel without knowing more of her story aside from what was shared by the man. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a single childhood memory of her. But I trust my mother\u0026rsquo;s stories of how this woman, shunned by the outside world because of her disability, never married, and lived with her family all her life (she\u0026rsquo;s now in her 60s), used to protect me with everything she had, used to treat me like her own blood.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame I could never remember. But I want to believe that subconsciously, perhaps even in my body, I do remember that during a brief period in the first couple of years of my life on this planet, a quiet stranger showed me true love, something I may never experience again in my adult life.\n","date":"1 September 2022","permalink":"/tlw/004/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Sabel"},{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s a bottom-up approach to discovering your [[purpose|purpose]].\nI am partial to the idea that when we were born, we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a given purpose ([[there is no destiny|there is no destiny]]). Even if there was one, we were not aware of it. My intuition tells me that it was tiny decisions I made along the way from childhood to adulthood that determined what we I am interested about at the current moment. We try different things out and take note of what resonated to us and what didn\u0026rsquo;t ([[convergence-divergence model of creativity]]).\nHowever, trying different things out produce too much information and magnets of attention that could easily produce overwhelm. We need a certain tool—a purpose or a question—to make sense of all these information. This means that a purpose is simply a narrowing tool that gives us a sense of control and direction.\nRealizing that purpose is simply a convergence tool implies that you can [[find your purpose through divergence–convergence|find your purpose through divergence–convergence]].

But if you were, I apologize. I went through a lot in the past three weeks, forcing me to rethink how I write and share online.\nI have decided to simplify (again) my newsletter writing system, so I can focus on tending my forest garden of the mind. Moving forward, I am implementing the following changes:\nMy other newsletter, Lilim, will be integrated into Uman. This means that all future Lilim issues will be linked to Uman. Managing one newsletter is more straightforward than two. Uman will continue to be sent monthly but in a simpler format. Instead of spending four days and more piecing together a narrative of my past month, I will be using Uman to share links to changes I made to my website, which mainly include writing progress I have made in my forest garden. I\u0026rsquo;ll be linking to notes about what I am referring to as my \u0026ldquo;forest garden of the mind\u0026rdquo; in the next Uman issue, but for now, you can go around my website and poke around its design to get an idea of what I am talking about. With that out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s get right into the July issue of Uman. Uman, the Pangasinan word for \u0026ldquo;change,\u0026rdquo; documents the monthly changes I go through as I walk the long walk of life. It serves as a cairn to the journey, marking where I have been in both geographic and intellectual excursions for an entire month.\nHere is July 2022\u0026rsquo;s cairn.\nPhilosophical and other studies #Thoreau #I reviewed and improved my notes on Henry David Thoreau. I studied and thought about Thoreau for a good chunk of July 2022. I researched his choice of literary medium: the romantic excursion, and read about his quest to live his unique version of transcendentalism and how this organized his various interests. I also continued reading Walden.\nBut the most crucial step I took with my relationship with Thoreau this month was learning about Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s philosophical stance after reading the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on him. It showed me how different I am from him philosophically, which was mind-blowing and depressing at the same time.\nThe Quest #Reading about Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s quest inspired me to think about my own. I journaled about and published an initial note on my forest garden: my quest.\nPhilosophy is the core of my work #Philosophy is still my main work. The most critical work is studying and living (writing is already part of studying). Sharing is writing for others, which is not necessarily the point. The core of my work does not involve others—just myself.\nI reaffirmed that the writing I do in private is the most important writing I do, which I partly learned from Thoreau. Thoreau prioritized content over style in his writing, and his journal was his magnum opus.\nLyrical philosophy #But if philosophy was my main work, what kind of philosophizing and philosophical writing am I attracted to?\nI started reading Lost Intimacy in American Thought by Edward Mooney. It is an interesting book whose thesis is that there is a circle of philosophers who \u0026ldquo;beheld\u0026rdquo; reality rather than \u0026ldquo;theorize\u0026rdquo; about it. They put themselves in the middle of reality rather than detach themselves from it. These are philosophers who I have never heard of but are associated with Thoreau by their methods and style. The form of philosophy they wrote can be described as lyrical philosophy. To learn more about this philosophy, I read the journal article \u0026ldquo;Lyrical Philosophy or How to Sing with Mind\u0026rdquo; by Mikhail Epstein and Mooney\u0026rsquo;s definition of lyrical philosophy in his blog.\nI particularly enjoyed Mooney\u0026rsquo;s lyrical writing, although it can be cryptic sometimes. I checked if he has a blog. He does, although he no longer updates it. Through Mooney, I discovered Henry Bugbee and his lyrical, philosophical work The Inward Morning. I am currently studying it and finding inspiration from how he did philosophy. I also journaled about Henry Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s philosophical method and how they relate to the fact that \u0026ldquo;we learn to live while we are living.\u0026rdquo; Lastly, Bugbee\u0026rsquo;s vision helped me rearticulate my purpose: my purpose statement.\nOrdinary language philosophy #I also explored ordinary language philosophy, which was a reaction to the attempt by Bertrand Russell and the like to create a specialized language for philosophers based on logic. They argued that words and concepts could not be understood in isolation but in how they are used in everyday life. Ludwig Wittgenstein was one, if not the most influential proponent of ordinary language philosophy. To explore Wittgenstein, I read a few chapters from the book Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s Artillery.\nIdeas on experimenting with lyrical philosophy #I asked myself: express truth with beauty and I wrote what I wanted to create: artifacts of writing around universal subject matters, which are place-based and use the romantic excursion as their device.\nI then listed some ideas on how I could explore and create these forms of philosophy in my work. Thinking about lyrical philosophy made me ask about emotions and their difference from feelings. The more I think about it, the more I see that philosophy sprouts out of the same tree that poetry comes from: wonder. I journaled about this similarity: poetry and narrative trace their history so readers can re-enact them.\nPhotography and philosophy #Philosophy and photography can be complementary. The only time photography becomes disconnected from philosophy is if philosophy continues to become this academic intellectual theory-only exercise.\nBut photography takes on a different function if I take philosophy as a way to deepen life through both happiness and meaning. It becomes integral to the philosophical practice by the following examples:\nI take a philosophical thought and look for a photo to represent it. I use photography and walking to deepen my relationship with place and Nature. I use photography to elevate moments as I do with poetry. Writing #One of my goals last July was to try to get published somewhere. I am not doing this to \u0026ldquo;build a portfolio\u0026rdquo; or anything. I am simply curious about the process. I edited, rewrote, and translated some Pangasinan poems, which I then sent to an online journal. My friend Rem provided some much-needed feedback on the verses. Preparing the poems and communicating with the editors was very instructional.\nPhotography #I used Kaufman\u0026rsquo;s ideas from The First 20 Hours to identify the minimum viable steps I need to take to learn photography. The result: I was able to finalize my photography learning roadmap. By the way, I finally invested in an entry-level pro camera. I\u0026rsquo;m currently slowing down with learning photography, but I will jump right into the camera once I feel the photography itch again.\nWalking #I started reading Teju Cole\u0026rsquo;s beautiful debut novel Open City, a meditative collection of vignettes told from the perspective of one walker. I also read the first chapter or a few of Martin Bunzl\u0026rsquo;s Thinking While Walking. This book was written by a professional philosopher who used walking the Pacific Crest Trail to prompt him to philosophize. The general structure of the book was a narrative. Bunzl tackled one problem for every trail station, all ten of them. But the style of writing was academic philosophy and wasn\u0026rsquo;t very lyrical.\nIn July, I published a couple of Lilim issues:\nLilim 030 — Where Grass Once Turned Crimson Lilim 031 — Walking Lopez, Quezon, Part I(The Rules of Trolleys) In my journal, I wrote about what is most important to me during walks (connection with space, object, or scene is the most important part of my walk) and how I might be better off doing short philosophical walks in a specific place for an extended period rather than long walks.\nProjects #Reviewing and resetting goals #Lastly, I read James Clear\u0026rsquo;s web page on goal-setting and took some notes on Zotero. Then I read his article on Warren Buffet\u0026rsquo;s list. I pondered about the process and thought about how I could integrate it with my annual and monthly reviews. I applied the process, and it made it clear that my most significant projects in the coming months pertain to clarifying my life work.\nI created a few new notes to facilitate my thinking on this goal-setting process.\nwarren buffet list how to set goals avoid-at-all cost life goals ","date":"16 August 2022","permalink":"/uman/007/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 007 — July 2022"},{"content":"Lilim is a Filipino word that means shade.

Its small feet seem to float over the soil and led the animal as if they have a mind of their own. They know this trail, for they probably walk it every day. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep up.\nNot far from where I started, the mud began to get softer, and my heavy feet pressed on the ground. They couldn\u0026rsquo;t float over the soil, so I am unable to go any further.\nI stood up instead and looked around me. Nearby, I saw a fisherman\u0026rsquo;s house built on the banks of the fishpond over the water. Some clothes hang outside under the nipa roof. If those clothes fall, which they will by a strong wind, they will fall directly into the water, which reflects the house and the trees behind it.\nIn front of me, on the trail, a few long bamboo poles were lying down. They are big enough to build a bridge over these fishponds, but not big enough to provide structure for a house. Someone left them here, but he\u0026rsquo;ll return to get them back when the soil on the trail starts to harden again. Over the horizon, large cumulus clouds begin forming over the blue sky.\nMy eyes got tired of looking around. Perhaps they were trying to do the walking I couldn\u0026rsquo;t do now. My feet couldn\u0026rsquo;t float over the muddy trail. But my eyes, my eyes could do the floating anytime, anywhere. And yet, they are tired, so I settled my gaze on the water and the banks of this fishpond below my feet. I crouched and looked for what I could find.\nA few young mangroves grew here. Around one mangrove, I saw something move fast over the mud. It was almost invisible. Its color blended with the ground and was very, very tiny. Here, the locals call it tustusak or mananaltak. A Google search would say it is a mudskipper. This one is so small, it is probably a baby—but a baby who knows how to swim, who knows these waters, and who moves really fast.\nNot far from it, something larger began to move. It had an irregularly circular form. Whatever was underneath it, it patiently carried that dome. Meanwhile, on a dead mangrove branch nearby, a cone-shaped shell was also on a very, very slow expedition. I was looking at both shells, patiently waiting for whoever completes its journey first, when, out of nowhere, a gray katang (crab) walked sideways between the two.\nI stood back up, still smiling, my legs a little cramped. The cumulus clouds over the horizon grew much bigger, and what was once a bright morning was starting to dim. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t walk this trail, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. The creatures I saw were enough. Like my eyes, they did the walking for me.\nI started my way back to the railroad when a large figure swam under a forest of mangroves on my right. It stopped, as if it sensed my movement when I stopped. I moved slightly, and it too moved, swimming towards the next mangrove. This time, I looked at it intently, reminding me of the tustusak I saw just a while ago. But this had a brighter color, yellow-green, and it was bigger, much, much bigger. So, this is how they look like as adults.\nThey say that mudskippers are fishes that learned to walk on land. Some speculate that they are the ancestors of four-limbed vertebrates, like apes, where we came from. If they are right, I am looking at my grandfather or grandmother right now. And that is a good thought to end this very, very short walk.\n","date":"1 August 2022","permalink":"/lilim/032/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 032 — Walking Lopez, Quezon Part II (A Fishpond at San Jose)"},{"content":"There is something magical about walking beside the railroad at San Jose, on a crisp summer morning. An ironic silence wraps over and under the tracks, amplified by the thin fog that hazes metal, stone, and wood. At first, you won’t see a single soul walking here at this time of the day. The narrow concrete road beside the tracks is fair game for any solitary saunterer. And yet—and you only get this once you’ve stayed here for at least a couple of days—you know that any minute now, a noisy trolley, which locals call “skates,” would appear. You anticipate its arrival, and this dance between silence and anticipation creates that magic.\nThe trolley could come either from behind or in front of you. Only the squeal of metal announces the arrival of one or two or even three of these humble modes of transportation. On Sundays, expect many of them, mostly carrying families visiting the resorts along Lopez Bay. But some would also carry hollow blocks, gallons of water, or tubs full of fish. When several of them are about to occupy a specific segment of the railroad, you will witness an interesting theatre of bigayan (literally, “giving way”), a stronger flavor of what you would experience when riding the more popular jeep.\nInside the jeep, especially in the Tagalog regions where drivers are without conductors, anyone who rides these public utility vehicles is expected to observe two main rules: (1) Let seniors and people with disabilities occupy the seats nearest the entrance and (2) help the driver collect the fare from other passengers by receiving the money, reaching out, and handing it over to a passenger nearer the driver. You are expected to perform this last rule, even if the passenger paying the fare hands their money over to you without saying “please” or “thank you.” It is a felt rule (pakiramdaman), which Westerners or even other Asians visiting the country and riding the jeep for the first time will never fully understand. And yet, it reflects one of the deepest cultural values Filipinos share—bigayan—a value that is, admittedly, on a decline as newer, more individualistic values challenge it. There are other rules inside the jeep, like women should never sabit or hold on to the handrails at the entrance of the jeep, so one can ride without sitting. Sabit usually happens when passengers are desperate to go home, and jeeps are already scarce. It’s traditionally taboo to see women, especially in a skirt, hanging behind jeeps. Men inside are expected to trade seats with women. But these rules are already being broken or are seldom applied.\nIn abandoned railroads, such as this in San Jose, trolleys are king, and bigayan takes on a more complex and interesting personality. Only a single trolley could use a stretch of the railroad at any time. This means that if two, three, or even four trolleys meet at a section of the railroad, only one can use the tracks first, and everyone else will wait for their turn. This constraint triggers a swift but beautiful display of bigayan, facilitated not with words but with pakiramdaman. Every single trolley driver knows these felt rules. They know if they need to give way or if they hold the right to use the rails first, and the decision-making happens in about three to five seconds. Once a decision has been made, passengers stand up, get off the trolley, move to the concrete road beside the rails, then the driver carries the trolley (thankfully, it is mostly wood) and parks it on the side. Boom. Boom. Boom. One after another, lego pieces fall beautifully into place.\nThe felt rules that make such a display of pakikipagkapwa (fellowship) possible are as follows:\nMore people trump fewer people. The trolley with the least number of people in it should give way to trolleys with more people. More baggage trump fewer baggage. Even if there are fewer people in a trolley, if the trolley contains more baggage, the trolley with people with no or less baggage will give way. Heavier and fragile baggage trump normal baggage. Trolleys with baggage that are hard to carry or are fragile (e.g., sacks of rice, gallons of water, hallow blocks, etc.) should pass first. More trolleys in one direction trump fewer trolleys in the opposite direction. Multiple trolleys going in the same direction should pass first, and a single or fewer trolleys going in the opposite direction should give way, except if they contain baggage mentioned in rule 3. Ideally, the driver who ought to give way has to make a judgment call while his trolley is still reasonably far from the trolley who is entitled to first use the rails. This prompt decision prevents waste of time and signals other trolley drivers that he knows the rules. If the driver makes a very late judgment call, the other drivers will let him know.\nThis morning, there were no trolleys on this segment of the rails in San Jose. Only cold air runs over the immovable metals. After crossing the bridge, I saw a trail on my right, which led to several fishponds. A white dog appeared behind me and entered the path, walking briskly over soft mud.\nNothing was happening on the rails of San Jose.\nSo, I entered the trail and followed the dog.\n","date":"18 July 2022","permalink":"/lilim/031/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 031 — Walking Lopez, Quezon Part I (The Rules of Trolleys)"},{"content":"I wasn’t ready, but I did it anyway. The agony of not doing it, of keeping it as an unticked box in my list of goals, which was already a carryover of last year, was stronger than the agony of possible failure.\nLast June 9, 2022, I walked 14 miles (22.53 km) from my house in Los Baños to San Pablo City in Laguna, Philippines. I did it in almost exactly five hours. The night before the walk, I slept only four hours. I tried to sleep more than this, but I just couldn’t. I felt like a fly lost in a cocktail of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty. I was frightened of what the following day held. Earlier that night, I announced my intention to walk to a few close friends. I was still ashamed to tell the world about the walk, but I badly needed encouragement from people who care. I just had to tell someone, anyone, whom I felt safe with. “Just do it. Enjoy the walk,” my friends said. But even with their kind words of support, I still felt like a fake. I never felt that much resistance to something that was so natural to me. Why would I be afraid of something as trivial as walking?\nIn hindsight, I know now that what I did wasn’t trivial at all. It was just a walk, yes, but it was a 14-mile walk. No one I know of personally in my family and in my circle of friends has done such a thing. I didn’t have someone I know of whom I can model what I was about to do then. I have Thoreau and Craig Mod to inspire me. But they come from entirely different contexts. They were white men who were capable of conquering the world through a walk. What I needed then was an inspiration from somewhere familiar, from within the Philippines—someone who has walked what I was about to walk and someone who has fairly the same motivations. However, I haven’t found any, at least not yet. Most of my friends hike mountains, some even do it for days. But I am yet to meet someone in person who has walked a few hours, days even, traversing multiple towns. It was something ancient people did in these islands, definitely, but not something anyone perfectly sane would do in a time of traffic. The futility of walking 14 miles in five hours even became clearer to me when I rode the jeep home and arrive back at Los Baños in just about 40 minutes. I have never ridden a jeep and feel so surreal before.\nGoing through all of those difficult emotions, no wonder I postponed doing the walk many times in the past year. But on June 8, the day before the walk, I checked the weather forecast and saw that after two days, the rains are coming to Laguna. If I am going to do this, I told myself, I should do it now. I looked at the map of Laguna and chose a destination. I needed somewhere worthy of arriving at, somewhere I could pass by several towns before arriving, and somewhere I could arrive in about half a day. San Pablo was an easy choice. It was a big city, it has seven lakes to visit, and walking towards it would require me to pass by the towns of Bay and Calauan. I was still terrified of the thought of going somewhere I have never been to on foot. But on the morning of June 9, Thursday, when the sun was already up in the sky, I opened the door and started walking, one step at a time.\nI am glad that I did. That long walk, my first of what I am hoping to be many, taught me important lessons about what I want to do with the weeks left in my life.\nWhat the Walk Taught Me About Photography #By forcing myself to do the walk, I naturally shifted my attention this month to one of my primary interests: photography. Since the walk will take a lot of time and energy, I would like to take the most advantage of it by taking the best photos I can get. My problem, though, was that I had limited photography training.\nLast year, I met Craig Mod’s work serendipitously. His newsletters, all of which I am subscribed to, planted the seeds in my mind of the possibility of not just being a writer but being a writer-photographer. Before last year, I was already taking some decent photos on my phone for many years. I seldom used stock photography on my blog posts; I took them myself on my walks. However, I had very unsophisticated knowledge of what makes a good photograph. I knew the rule of thirds and how to use basic Snapseed editing. But that was it. Seeing Craig’s work and feeling moved by it inspired me to dive deeper into photography.\nI took one course on iPhone photography. Mobile photography was what made sense to me at that time. I reasoned that I was not ready to invest in an expensive camera if I didn’t even know how to use what I currently have. I was not yet sure I wanted to pursue photography, so I used my iPhone Pro 11 Max while exploring the medium. After spending about a month learning, my photography improved, and I started getting good feedback from newsletter readers and friends I volunteered to photograph. I continued tinkering with the interest, but like all my interests, I decided to park photography to focus on other interests that felt more natural, mainly writing and philosophy. I was primarily a writer and a thinker, and I wasn’t yet particularly satisfied with my skills in either, so why would I spend more time on a new skill? I told myself.\nHowever, planning the walk from Los Baños to San Pablo forced me to return to photography. Before and during the walk, I started studying editing more. I discovered Lightroom mobile and started taking photos through its mobile camera app, so I can take RAW images and not just the JPEG photos that the iPhone’s native camera app produces. I still didn’t have a pro camera. I still didn’t feel the need to have one before and during the walk. But after learning to edit and taking more photos, I slowly realized how much a professional camera could produce better photo quality. Because of this walk, I think I am already in a position where my skills and desire to learn warrant investing in a beginner pro camera.\nMore importantly, this month’s deep dive into photography made me see an important fact. I saw how too technical photography can be and how easy it is to drown in this technicality without accomplishing any good work. A budding photographer can easily drown in the concepts, techniques, and facts associated with this field that it is so easy to forget why one is taking photos in the first place. The science of photography can easily out-power the art. To tackle both issues, I decided to pause my learning and do a meta-learning project to create a personalized curriculum for self-studying photography. I wanted to find the best resources to teach myself the basics, then move immediately to learning the works of photographers that I resonate with, so I can start honing my photographic voice.\nThe two biggest questions I had about photography during and after the walk were: What subject will I photograph in my walks? And what stories do I want to tell through my photographs? I noticed that street and travel photographers almost always have some rough idea of what to look for even before their walks. They still allow the stories to arise organically during the walk, but they have a rough idea that guides their photography throughout the walk. For example, Alec Soth portraits people, while Craig Mod shots artifacts of domestic life (e.g., laundry). Both their approach is anthropological. They intend to learn about the place, the people, and the culture of where they are walking. I would realize later that, even if I find this kind of work inspiring, it may not be the best kind of photography that suits my personality.\nHowever, these questions about the subject and the story that my photographs ought to convey combined with another question that came to me when blisters were forming on the soles of my feet and my legs were burning from the heat: “Why walk?”\nWhat the Walk Taught Me About Walking #If you have been walking for three hours, the sun grilling every cell of your body, and you suddenly see that elevated highway from Calauan to San Pablo, of course, you have to ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;Why am I doing this?\u0026rdquo;\nI wish I have thought about that question way before doing the walk. I wish I had an articulate reason for doing this. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I knew I wanted to try it, and I have been reading Thoreau and Craig Mod for long enough not to. However, when the walk gets hard, which it did for me, you will realize that doing a long walk just because your heroes did one is not enough to get you through it. During and after the walk (the entire month of June), I spent a good amount of time just thinking about what walking meant to me, what I wanted to get from it, and what I hoped to use it for.\nI tried articulating my initial ideas, which first came to me during a long diary session, in a recent Lilim issue (Lilim 03(05)—Why Walk?). However, even after publishing that piece, I knew my thoughts about this matter were still incomplete. Since sharing that Lilim issue, I continued contemplating why I am so driven to walk.\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs I had while thinking about walking this month was remembering the trajectory of my relationship with walking throughout my life. As a child who grew up in a Christian evangelical household, walking was first a form of penitence. I did not particularly enjoy joining my parents on house-to-house walks, trying to talk to people about the bible, and sometimes experiencing ridicule from people who didn’t like what we did. When I went to college, however, I embraced the faith of my parents and made it my own. Suddenly, walking transformed from being an activity I disliked into a platform to achieve a mission I dedicated myself to. I became a young pastor very early and led a small group of sign language interpreters walking, sometimes hiking, the mountains of Baguio City and La Trinidad, Benguet, to visit the Deaf and bring them “the good news.”\nIn 2012, when I finally decided to renounce my childhood religion, I left the house on my bike as my parents and sisters rode in the car to attend the memorial of Christ\u0026rsquo;s death. That happened one late afternoon in the summer. It was the first memorial I intentionally missed. I rode my bike and found a large mango tree under which I sat down to write. Little did I know that this started my daily late afternoon communion with Nature, which I since did through biking to a spot and walking while pulling my bike beside me. Walking became this organic reaction to that painful act of defiance, of leaving. I ran away from an established worldview only to slowly walk towards nothingness, towards a place where I can build my own worldview piece by piece from the ground up all by my own hands. Walking was leaving and approaching at the same time.\nAnd yet, years after 2012, I would walk the same paths that I walked as a preacher in Baguio and Pangasinan. As a different person, walking the same paths triggered memories of that past and reconnected me with who I was before as I tapped into the wisdom I seemed to have left in those trails. Surprisingly, walking the same trails made me feel good. It reminded me of what good I had back then and how I might reintegrate those into my new life without the baggage of the past. Re-walking those paths reinforced my desire to make walking an integral part of my life as a writer, poet, and photographer. Walking is reconnecting and renewal.\nWhile walking allows me to remember, it also allows me to forget, so I can find new ways of thinking and being. Ten years since I left the church, I still feel like I am looking for something, and the search is far from over. I continue to search for what was once passed down to me by my parents: community, purpose, and belief. Countless times over the decade, that search felt stagnant. Whenever I take a step forward, I take two steps backward. Establishing new friendships is hard. Trying out new ideas only to replace them again is hard. Many times I felt like restarting from zero. Walking while all of these were happening gave me a feeling of momentum. Even if my life wasn\u0026rsquo;t moving, I always moved forward while walking. Although I am still looking for something during a walk, I do not feel the pressure to arrive, and it always feels like I am making progress. Walking reminds me to keep searching until I find what I am looking for but to do so with a lighter heart. Walking is consolation for the seeker.\nBut walking isn\u0026rsquo;t just therapy. Perhaps the most important relationship I fostered with walking throughout the years is how I organically transformed it into the canvass where I do my work as a writer, poet, and photographer. In my past life as a preacher, walking was simply a means towards an end. I needed to walk a road that led to the house of a Deaf I would be preaching to that day. Today, walking is no longer just a means to do my work. Walking is the work itself. I can\u0026rsquo;t think well and produce insight without walking. I do my best thinking and my rest from it while walking. I catch poems and practice my photography while outdoors, walking. I write field notes, which I flesh out into narratives in my journal—records that I later publish in Lilim. After the long walk to San Pablo City, I also saw firsthand the power of using a long walk to deeply experience and understand the culture, history, politics, and social dynamics of a space. If these are not enough motivations to walk, then think about all the beauty one only sees when walking, the opportunity to practice mindfulness, the health benefits, and the serendipitous meeting with strangers. After the long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo, it became clear that I was attracted to walking throughout my life because it allows me to heal, be myself, and become the person I want to be. In other words, I always saw walking as a tool for personal development.\nAside from these large lessons on walking, I also picked up a few practical learnings about it, which, I hope, will help me prepare for my next long walk.\nThe Philippines is not very walk-friendly. Sidewalks are lacking. If cyclists are already struggling, how much more are walkers? This fact might be why most outdoor activities in the Philippines consist of hiking or biking. Almost no one writes about walking. In other countries, I heard you can use a service where your baggage is sent to your destination. This service frees you up with lots of weight while walking, which, based on my experience, is much needed if you want to endure the walk. Furthermore, there are no clear walking trails or routes in the Philippines. We have hiking trails but not flat walking routes. However, just because the Philippines is not as walkable as other places doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean walking is impossible to do here. It just requires a bit more effort and creativity to perform a multi-day and multi-town walk. Carry the minimum viable baggage. Because there are no baggage services, you must be more mindful when taking a long walk in the Philippines. One of the biggest mistakes on the trek was bringing my 6-lb. MacBook Pro Mid-2012. It was the heaviest part of my baggage. I will bring a lighter laptop and fewer clothes if I do another long walk. I will take advantage of fast laundry services at my destination rather than increase my baggage\u0026rsquo;s weight by bringing more clothes. Because the Philippines is not walkable, I am unsure whether a multi-week-long walk is logistically possible. This problem is something I need to think more about. Again, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a model to follow, so I am discovering this all on my own. No social media during the walk. Once on the walk, you get excited (or perhaps bored and alone) that it is almost natural to bring out your phone, document it live, and share it immediately. Early on my walk, this is what I did. I posted an announcement via Facebook that I was doing a long walk, and I will be posting live updates (that\u0026rsquo;s right, when you are on the walk and excited, all your fears the other night vanishes). It was like a way for me to write field notes, although in front of an audience. While I am grateful for the comments I received in that post, which contained recommendations for places to visit and kind encouragement, I regret posting the updates live. Doing so took my mind away from the walk itself and made the walk feel very performative. Next time, I might do daily updates via social media or, better yet, implement a pop-up newsletter as my heroes do. Take care of your body. I should\u0026rsquo;ve started the walk at dawn to avoid the Philippine heat. But since I slept late, I woke up later than I originally planned. I also prepared the morning of the walk (a bad, bad idea). I finished preparing at around 8 am, and the sun was already high. Moreover, I didn\u0026rsquo;t put sunblock on my legs and feet. I also didn\u0026rsquo;t know I should put some lubricant on my feet\u0026rsquo; soles to prevent blisters. Midway through the walk, my feet started having them, and they hurt until I got home to Los Baños the following day. What the Walk Taught Me About Writing #Although the long walk forced me to strengthen my photography skills and uncover my motivations for walking, I realized that photography and walking alone are insufficient in creating the most important element in this process: meaning.\nAfter the walk, with numerous photos, field notes, and memories in hand, the question remained: What will I do with all of these? Thinking about this question reminded me that my walks and photos will be more meaningful if I am more intentional about them—if I use them to deepen my sense of meaning.\nLiving is living. As is, it is mundane. What I was hoping to get from my walks is a connection with the ordinary, the real stuff of life, but also a connection that was more than this. I wanted to see and touch and experience but also elevate all these by transforming them into an artifact that deepens my sense of meaning. I wanted the artifact and the process of creating it to contribute to this meaning-making. There is no better way to do that, at least for me, than to contemplate on it, savor it, think about it, and while doing all of this, write about it. Because writing is the best facilitator I know for meaning-making.\nThis meaning-making process, I realized, starts by taking good field notes. I take mine using Drafts, a writing app on my phone that lets me quickly capture any thought or observation that comes to me during a walk. I learned recently that Craig Mod takes notes via audio recording instead. While walking, he talks over his phone and records things as he notices them. For outsiders, he is simply on a call. I tried doing this recently, and although it feels weird at first, it definitely is more convenient.\nBut this meaning-making process will only succeed once we return to those notes and flesh them out into longer narratives. We can start by handwriting the initial narrative in our journal before transferring it to a digital form where it is easier to play around with. Narrative writing forces one to find general, abstract interconnections between what would rather be disparate events and facts. A story has a strong psychological, almost therapeutic, effect on the storyteller as it organizes and naturally interprets chaos. I am not inherently good at narrative writing, so I am doing my best to improve it and incorporate it more and more into my writing. I did that last month, although not with the same intensity I put on photography, by transcribing and editing several narratives I wrote in the past into my Talahardin. I also practiced copying Ben Hewitt’s vignette writing style and using that to write Lilim 03(06)—Where Grass Once Turned Crimson.\nBut perhaps the best investment I made last month on improving my narrative writing and meaning-making, in general, was ordering the third edition of Kissa by by Craig Mod and reading it in two sittings over coffee and cake. Reading Kissa by Kissa showed me what is possible by walking. Opening the book and reading the first few chapters convinced me instantly that I wanted to create something like it. I wanted to be a walker, photographer, and writer all in one. Whatever doubts I had about these three identities merging into one vanished. The visceral experience of immersing myself in such a beautiful object showed me what is possible in my life work for the years to come. But reading the book also informed me of the kind of writing I want to pursue.\nKissa by Kissa is an anthropological piece of art. It concerns itself more with place, people, history, and culture. While this excites and inspires me, I distrust myself to create something like it. I feel like I am less courageous than Craig Mod in engaging in conversations with strangers. I try my best to greet strangers along the way and talk to them as much as possible, but not in a way that will produce the stories to write a book like those in Kissa by Kissa. I need to accept who I am: both my strengths and weaknesses. My strength as a writer is finding insights and beauty during walks and sharing them as best as possible. This strength entails that the kind of writing I think I could and want to write is in the tradition of Thoreau and Dillard—walking or walking-inspired poetic prose that combines narrative with palatable philosophical language. And by philosophy, I only mean grappling with the question, “How to live?” This writing is the kind of writing I think I want to focus on moving forward—writing centered on the human quest to learn how to live better with the outdoors as its backdrop.\nOf course, I also create meaning through photography. But with photography, it is a bit more challenging. It is difficult to be more intentional with the images one captures since most images pop out along the way. However, being clear about the kind of images, not necessarily the exact pictures I want to take, definitely assures that my photos are more deliberate and interconnected. Moving forward, I want my photographs to be repositories of meaning. They would be an extension of text, although I am also open for them to dictate the path that text follows.\nWhat the Walk Taught Me About Living #The core of what I want to do with my life is to cultivate a rich inner life by learning to be alone well through a combination of experience in the real world, in space, and deep thought. In other words, walking + writing. These two are not the only fundamental parts of the life I want to live. But they make up the engine that drives this life. The gamble I am taking is that through investing about 80–90% of my efforts in the solitude that walking and writing necessitates—that is, in cultivating an unquenchable passion for this inner life through a self-directed pseudo-monastic practice—everything else falls into place. I put faith in the ability of walking + writing to nurture the virtues I want to embody as I go out and show up in the real world: deep understanding, moderation, humility, modesty, joy, and perhaps, most important of all, compassion. Given my knowledge of who I am, I don’t know if I can reverse this process. I couldn’t build a public image first a let that trickle down into my private self. It just wouldn’t work for me.\nIf anything enduring came from my first long walk from Los Baños to Laguna, that is the cementing of this prioritization of inner life into my psyche. The long walk and the pain that went with it made me realize how much I am committed to the inner world that I am willing to be out in a less comfortable situation just so I can be totally in here. Publishing Uman and Lilim is important. Talking to my readers is important. Going out and meeting new people is important. Being around family and friends is important. But none is as important as doing the core of the work: enriching my inner life through walking and writing.\nIn Kissa by Kissa Craig Mod reveals that his desire to look for and learn about the kissas of Japan and the pizza toast that come with them was inspired by his experience as an adopted child, relocating to a foreign country, and not feeling any sense of belongingness. The kissa became his haven in Japan, and the pizza toast his comfort food. After reading this, I asked myself whether I have a similar organic relationship with walking. What was my kissa? What was my pizza toast? What draws me towards walks, no matter how short they are? What I learned surprised me.\nI am naturally drawn towards dirt roads—underdeveloped roads that link main roads and highways to farms. These are the only real walking routes in the flat Philippines—accessible to most Filipinos living in the provinces and their suburbs. These dirt roads were where I walked most of my life, where most of my thoughts, photographs, and poems came to me. It is there where I mended my broken heart, broken psyche, and broken soul throughout my young life. Unlike Craig, I am not drawn toward a specific object but all things in my safe space. And throughout all the walks I took in my 30 years of existence, my hope was always to come back home after a walk a better person, and if not better, then at least renewed so that I can go back the next day and try once more.\n","date":"6 July 2022","permalink":"/uman/006/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 006 - June 2022 (What Walking from Los Baños to San Pablo Taught Me)"},{"content":"Lea is bound to go home this afternoon, but we first decided to try the bingsu at Seoul Kitchen. The place is small but neat. But one feels that it is trying so hard to become something it isn’t: an authentic Korean restaurant. On the walls, stickers abound, reminding—almost castigating—people to practice social distancing and to keep their noisy little children’s mouths shut. The bingsu is good, although the mangoes are too sour for my liking. The kimbap is not bad.\nAfter seeing Lea ride the jeep home, I walk towards the campus. At the bridge on Royal Palm Ave., two young construction workers were pushing a wheelbarrow. One is holding the left handle with his left hand, and the other is holding the right handle with his right hand, pushing their bodies together in an awkward display. They hobbled at the edge of the road like adult conjoined twins. They reminded me of a similar image I took in Baguio a long time ago of two baggers walking with their arms around each other. It was the best display of bromance I have ever seen.\nAt Freedom Park, I see the lone 7-eleven that closed in 2020. “Temporary store closure,” the sign on its door says. But it hasn’t opened even after stores inside and outside the campus have. It is a reminder of what the pandemic has done. Meanwhile, around the park, a crowd of unmasked joggers, walkers, and picnickers remind me of what life was before the pandemic and what it could be in the months ahead.\nFurther up the park, I see the marker for the internment camp. I’ve seen it in the past but didn’t care much until I read the accounts of what happened inside that place. The marker sits beside Baker Hall, which is weird because Baker Hall was never part of the camp. The choice of its location was perhaps pragmatic. Let’s put it away from the park itself, away from the grasses where picnickers now sit and football players kick ball, away from where a skull may once have rolled and where grass once turned crimson.\nNear the animal science buildings, I see this old tower-like structure that looks like a long chimney. I walk toward it and take some photos from below. The tower is part of a network of buildings that look older than others on the campus, and with face-to-face classes still not fully back, they look more aged and abandoned. I follow the path that cleaved between the buildings, leading me to a heavily graffitied two-story structure that reminded me of stables in cowboy films. The second floor looks like a large conference hall, while the first floor comprises smaller rooms that were, perhaps, previously offices. I study the writings from afar, admiring this piece of public art. Suddenly, a guard appears out of nowhere and starts walking toward me. I look back at the graffitis and take one last photo, pretending not to care. Then I started walking back to where I came from, at a pace faster than usual, doing what any graffiti artist would do.\n","date":"3 July 2022","permalink":"/lilim/030/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 030 — Where Grass Once Turned Crimson"},{"content":"Ang paglalakad habang umuulan ay may sarili ring timpla\nmas mabilis ang agos ng tubig kapag mapaparaan ka sa batis\nkasabay ng koro ng mga palakang nakarating na sa langit.\nKung nakapayong ka susundan ka\nng tunog ng maliliit na patak ng ulan\nhabang tumatalsik ang putik sa likod ng iyong binti.\nAt kapag dumaan ang malakas na hangin\nna tatangay sa payong mo\nhayaan mong maghabulan ang hangin at ang payong.\nMay panibago kang tungkuling hindi makapagaantay\nang magpakalunod sa kalayaang\nsa paglalakad lamang sa ilalim ng ulan matitikman.\nTignan ang orihinal sa talahardin.\n","date":"30 June 2022","permalink":"/buhian/ang-maglakad-sa-ulan/","section":"Buhians","summary":"","title":"Ang Maglakad sa Ulan"},{"content":" My shoulders started to feel tight. I sensed a slight pain at the bottom of my spine. As I took another step, I grabbed both shoulder straps of my backpack to pull them forward away from my chest. As soon as I did this, I felt my bag\u0026rsquo;s soft but warm cushion on my back, and the pain in my shoulders subsided. I looked in front of me and saw a shadow—a tree! A small one, but enough to take a short standing rest. On my left, two dump trucks moved like tortoises climbing a rock. Behind them, a long line of cars started to form. I stopped under the tree, with the sound of traffic nearby. I turned to my right, and that was when I saw it—one of the three summits of Mt. Banahaw, the active complex volcano of Laguna, often associated with the supernatural. It was there, peering behind thick foliage, as if watching, even mocking me for the fool I made myself become. \u0026ldquo;What the fuck am I doing?\u0026rdquo; I asked myself as I looked at Mt. Banahaw. \u0026ldquo;Why am I walking?\u0026rdquo;\nI knew I needed to answer this question after walking for more than five hours, with intermittent breaks of 5–10 minutes, from Los Baños to San Pablo, Laguna. It is a full 13-mile walk, half of which was an elevated road that reached 535 feet (0.16 kilometers) max. I did the entire walk from 8:00 am to around 1:00 pm, mostly under a torching sun, which eased after the sky turned gray and beads of water started falling by the end of the walk. I reached San Pablo City by afternoon and found myself sitting at an almost empty diner on the second floor of a building along the city\u0026rsquo;s main street. I was staring down at the road when it started to rain hard.\nI was relieved to finally arrive and ordered enough food to congratulate myself with pistachio sans rival at the end of the meal to remind me what it feels like to feel good. The long walk had to feel good, and it did, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t what I expected it to be. And I know the reason was partly because of rookie mistakes: not putting lotion on my feet (therefore, blisters), bringing more than what was necessary (therefore, backaches), and leaving when the sun was already high (therefore, sunburn on my legs and feet).\nBut the walk was difficult, more because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t entirely sure why I was doing it. I could go through something like this and feel a lot better if I am strongly motivated—if I had a vision, I know I am fulfilling as I take one step after another. But this walk had no larger vision. It was entirely a \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s see if this feels right\u0026rdquo; kind of walk. I turned 30 last February, and more than ever, I felt a sense of urgency to articulate what I wanted to do with the weeks left in my life. And I couldn\u0026rsquo;t express what exactly I wanted to do if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done enough tinkering— if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t tried stuff. This first long multi-day walk was part of this tinkering process.\nI knew I liked walking, perhaps more obsessively than most people. I am surprised by the rigor I put into this thing I am hesitant to call a craft since it is too simple to associate any mastery into. And yet, I feel like it does involve some measure of skill, which attracts me in a visceral, sometimes incomprehensible way. But I need to start uncovering my motivations for doing it. I have to start understanding this drive to walk so that I can begin crafting a vision for it.\nWalking is Being #My ultimate life vision has been to understand this world, my place in it, and how I should move in it. I dream of being on my deathbed one day (or wherever death overcomes me) and saying to myself, \u0026ldquo;I have lived well. I have lived a life of meaning.\u0026rdquo; That is the ultimate vision. And walking is perhaps an unlikely means to fulfill that.\nBut why walk when I could probably be better off dedicating my life to a cause, working with people, and fighting for those in need, as I did in the past? Why choose a mostly solitary activity that is impractical, hard, seemingly selfish, and frighteningly pointless?\nA natural extension of articulating a personal vision is to identify the means toward it. Now, a personal vision is, as it sounds, deeply personal. There is no single way to live a life. The question is \u0026ldquo;How do I ought to live?\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;How do we ought to live?\u0026rdquo; because living is intrinsically subjective, and all attempts to create absolute rules of living that everyone must follow will ultimately fail. Knowing this, it is not enough to craft our vision; we also have to find a way towards it that is true to who we are, regardless of what the outside world tells us we need to be.\nThis work is necessary because the path towards fulfilling a vision is perhaps even more important than fulfilling the vision itself. It is impossible to feel good about a vision, to enjoy the journey towards it, if you know you reached it the wrong way—in a way that went against your values. In short, it isn\u0026rsquo;t enough that I become, but I become by simply being me. I need to fulfill a purpose and put meaning into my life in a way that is true to who I am. And for me, walking seems to fit the bill. Walking is who I am.\nWalking is me. I was the boy who grew up in the province while frequenting the fields. I was the high schooler who walked by himself from school to town to ride the jeep home. I was the preacher who went from one house to another, sometimes from one mountain to another, on foot to visit the Deaf. I was the depressed young adult who walked under trees and beside beaches to feel good. I was the traveler who hiked mountain after mountain to feel in awe. In walking, I learned simplicity and frugality as much as I learned about myself and my relationship with nature.\nWalking, when done right, achieves a lot for me. In walking, I connect with my body, allowing me to see the world as it is. I could practice photography, which is all but the art of seeing the beauty around me and elevating the present moment. Walking is a vehicle for deep thinking as much as it is a rest from it. And walking is an opportunity to listen to me, the world around me, and, when walking with someone, to others. Walking is a microcosm of life, a practice ground for life, if not life itself.\nWalking is Becoming #But walking is also the best vehicle I know to become who I want to be. Walking is one of the few activities where deep thought and presence—in one\u0026rsquo;s environment and body—can simultaneously occur. Deep presence is necessary to be truly there when something is happening. And we would like to be truly there so we remember, savor, and extract the sweetness and comfort of an experience. We need this because of what happens after deep presence: deep thought. Deep thought is necessary for what I like to call \u0026ldquo;meaning-making,\u0026rdquo; the practice of interpreting the events that occur in our lives in a way that helps us make sense of them. We want meaning-making because while presence makes sure we are happy and fulfilled at the experience, it isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to satisfy our longing for purpose, for profound meaning. Deep presence assures comfort. Deep thought ensures meaning.\nBy being present in my body and the world, I absorb experience, which becomes content for processing, for meaning-making. This cycle between direct experience and its interpretation is what spurs growth. Walking, of course, does not hold a monopoly on this cycle. But I find it an effective platform for my development in a way that feels unquestionably good.\nWalking perfectly represents this interplay between experience and thought, even to those who can\u0026rsquo;t or won\u0026rsquo;t walk. We can all \u0026ldquo;walk\u0026rdquo; figuratively by doing whatever we can to experience the world, to do something besides staying inside our heads. Because when we do come back to our heads, we bring something we can work with—a piece of memory or knowledge to sculpt and shape into whatever we want. This process, I think, is the best way to live. Not to rely solely on the experience of others recorded in books, but to go out there, to be present within our bodies, and to awaken our senses so that we may catch what needs to be acquired: the narratives that will get us through the dark night of the soul if not our whole life. This is what walking does.\n","date":"19 June 2022","permalink":"/lilim/029/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 029 — Why Walk?"},{"content":"Lolo Aldo lives in his house near the fishponds he owns, which now belongs to Tiyo Jessie, his son, who lives with him, watches over him while he lies down on bed every day. When we reached their humble house on that afternoon, Tiyo Jessie was having an early drinking matchup with a friend. Was it lambanog? I am not sure. There was a dog tied on a post outside the house, which we made sure to avoid. The animal was quiet, but Tiyo Jessie said it has bitten several already.\nThere as a bunch of us, most from Calamba—Lea\u0026rsquo;s family and Tita Joy. Everyone went to see Lolo Aldo but not everyone stayed long inside his room. I stayed because Lolo Aldo was a fellow Pangasinense, and Lea\u0026rsquo;s mom thought it would be nice for the old man to speak with someone who spoke his mother tongue again. I understand why they didn\u0026rsquo;t stay. His room was filled with urine stench—that stench which says, \u0026ldquo;I am losing control. And there is nothing I can do about it.\u0026rdquo; The opened windows, somehow, lessen the smell.\nSince the old man can no longer talk audibly, I had to come near him. \u0026ldquo;Taga iner kayod Pangasinan? (From where are you in Pangasinan?)\u0026rdquo; I asked him. \u0026ldquo;Maasin\u0026rdquo; he said, referring to one of the barangays of Mangaldan—a once railroad barangay, something I find interesting because he also, now, lives in a railroad barangay here in Lopez.\nWe talked a lot about many things but two things struck me. Lea\u0026rsquo;s mom asked him what food he wants to eat. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to care. What goes in his mouth doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to matter anymore. He has reached the point where the taste of food is irrelevant. He is in his 90s. His daughter would later say to us that he can\u0026rsquo;t eat much solid food. Soup on rice is usually enough. When asked what food he wants, he didn\u0026rsquo;t answer. He stayed silent for a while. And then he uttered the words I will never forget. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s near. The end is near for me. But thank you so much for remembering me. For visiting.\u0026rdquo; He then said he was tired and wanted to lie down. We helped him get back to his pillow and we all left the room.\nThree months later, I heard that people visited Lolo Aldo once more. He was no longer in his room. And the stench of urine was no longer in the air.\n","date":"8 June 2022","permalink":"/tlw/002/","section":"The Long Walk","summary":"","title":"Lolo Aldo"},{"content":"Not so long ago, I wrote about the happiness in self-forgetfulness. I wrote about that incredible feeling of exhilaration we encounter when we are so captivated by something else we forget about our anxieties. We usually experience this when we read a good book, listen to a piece of tantalizing music, or watch a well-executed film. Some would say we are escaping reality when we consume such good art. But I think a more accurate description of what is happening here is that we are running away from that ever domineering self-consciousness that Dillard called “a bitter birthday present from evolution.” Even more surprising is that from this forgetting comes peace of mind and healing—a silencing of troubles.\nHowever, I notice that we do self-forgetfulness easily when we are in front of media—screens or book pages (which are now also screens). These are the modern tools of transcendence. I am using transcendence here very loosely, but with good reasons. I believe that our experience of transcendence lies in a spectrum of different varieties and intensities. There are deeper forms of transcendence as shared by, say, serious meditators, but there are more ordinary and common forms that are readily accessible by anyone. As long as you have “escaped” self-consciousness, whatever you are doing, you have transcended. Flow, that ever-popular word referring to what artists and athletes experience when “in the zone,” is a form of transcendence. But even that lies on the farther edges of the spectrum. A more common form of transcendence is what we usually experience when consuming information stored in media. This form of transcendence is easier. It’s easier to be captivated by a Netflix movie than the silence of an empty room where you are sitting in the middle.\nMedia-less Transcendence #However, this over-reliance on media could stunt our ability to be alone with our senses. Yes, we are toolmakers and tool users, but earlier in our evolution, we only had our hands and mind to use, and we seem to have completely forgotten that those were enough for a very long time. It is important to experience self-forgetfulness and transcendence as organic as possible (i.e., through our bare senses) at least once in a while. It is harder, yes, but the experience is more enlightening, insightful, and freeing. Why? Because it puts us in direct contact with reality. And reality isn’t orchestrated like the story in a film or a book or a song. Reality is messy—a fluctuating arrangement (or perhaps disarrangement) of atoms and photons.\nThere is an important difference between these two ways of experiencing the world—two ways of seeing as Dillard describes it:\nThe difference between the two ways of seeing is the difference between walking with and without a camera. When I walk with a camera I walk from shot to shot, reading the light on a calibrated meter. When I walk without a camera, my own shutter opens, and the moment\u0026rsquo;s light prints on my own silver gut. When I see this second way I am above all an unscrupulous observer.\nIf being alone with your thoughts in a room is fatally difficult, try another form of organic experience that I discovered can be extremely transcendental: listening—pure listening with no intention of responding.\nWhen I listen to someone talk, I still consume structured or possibly even coordinated information. But there is an unexplainable quality to face-to-face conversations that make them richer than video or voice calls. Yet rightfully so. I am interacting with hormone-releasing flesh, not a radiation-emitting screen. Furthermore, even when it is structured, a conversation is still not immune from the vagueness of reality. It could lead anywhere; countless things could happen. It mimics the messy nature of reality. And yet, despite the mess, if I listen closely, without thinking about what to say back but simply being present with the other person, I inevitably forget about myself. I seem to become the other person, not in that magical wuwu way, but naturally and imaginatively, that happens within my own subjective experience.\nIronically, we couldn’t dismiss that curated information in media makes transcendence easier. The mind needs structure for it to quiet down. Give it form, and it will surrender itself, calm down, and ultimately forget. And this is what I love about reading. Reading feels like listening to someone talk for a long time without me thinking about responding, but in a well-structured and coordinated manner. When I read a good book, I find myself transcend—I forget that I am even existing.\nSo, I guess the path to self-forgetfulness is not a straight singular one. There are so many other roads towards it, and to ignore the others in favor of one is simply absurd and deprived. The more tools we have, the more resilient we are because if one tool is unavailable, we can still get the job done. In self-forgetfulness, we need to experience both media-assisted and media-less methods, then learn when to use each one appropriately. This principle of embracing different strategies, of trying other techniques, does not only apply to transcendence. It applies to almost every single pursuit in life.\nHow Two Birds Taught Me to Walk and Write Better #Early in May, I took a brief walk at Victoria M. Ela Avenue inside the UPLB campus. I started walking out of the house around 5 pm, so the sun was no longer that dark. I had to go home by 7 pm for dinner, so I only had two hopefully good hours to walk. At Ela, I stopped at the bridge and looked down at the Molawin creek. On the stream, I saw two birds cross the water towards the other bank full of stones. They looked like bush hens with long slender feet. They separated for a while in a very coordinated manner, as if identical birds were walking in separate directions or raptors hunting in sync. A few moments later, the two birds met again. They walked some more until they vanished under the shades of banana leaves. When they disappeared, the church bell nearby rang, and a teal kingfisher flew by.\nI wrote all of these in my field notes. But not long after this, it started to get dark, and I began to feel tired. I walked a bit at Freedom Park, then made my way home. While walking home, I couldn’t shake off what I had just seen, and that was when I realized I walked for about two hours but only witnessed a single of these moments worth writing. I only found a single piece of Dillard’s pennies.\nI went home that evening with a clear intention, brought by the feedback I received while actively doing something. From now on, I decided to extend my walking hours. I reasoned that if I could capture a single penny in two hours, I might catch another or more in four hours of walking. A few days after this, I did another walk, but now I started about an hour earlier, and boy was I rewarded with pennies at that walk!\nJust the act of extending time led me to write longer, more beautiful field notes that ultimately convinced me to relaunch Lilim, my once-archived weekly newsletter on walking. Since May 15, I have published four Lilim issues:\nLilim, 03(01) — A Mask of Darkness with No Eyes Lilim, 03(02) — All Them Dirt Roads Lilim, 03(03) — An Unwrapped Gift From the Universe Lilim 03(04) — Ang Heograpiya ng Buhay Feedback is everything in life, but more especially in the writing life. Last May, I finished reading DIY MFA by Gabriela Pereira, and there I came across a concept that I am very familiar with. I use it to start and maintain habits and systems. The idea is iteration. I never thought about how I could use the same concept to improve my writing life, though. Here are Pereira’s exact words on the subject:\nWith the “spin your wheels” approach, you try different techniques at random, you don’t track the outcomes, and then you make decisions based on a gut feeling. This method is fine if you have plenty of time on your hands and don’t care about getting results. For writers operating in the real world, I recommend iteration.\nThis approach to writing was inspired by the entrepreneurial model used in Silicon Valley and described by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup. In a lean start-up environment, developers create a minimal viable product (MVP) and then test and tweak it in cycles to produce the best version possible. As a writer, you can operate in the same way, testing and improving your process over time to become more productive and better at your craft. The key is to build that meta-component into your writing so that you don’t just scrutinize the words you put on the page but also take time to step back and examine your process overall.\nI plan on using this approach in the future with my writing life. Feedback from a single walk informed how I should do my walks and propelled me to relaunch an already archived newsletter. This process works! But it relies on noticing and being mindful of useful feedback. Then, as Pereira advises, perform mini-experiments by keeping all other variables constant and testing a single input. For example, moving forward, I am thinking about changing my Lilim publication schedule from weekly to biweekly in response to feedback. I notice that I have become too product-oriented since relaunching Lilim. I spend a lot of time writing, revising, and formatting essays and the quality of my thoughts has noticeably decreased. The weekly publishing schedule also conflicts when I am about to write this newsletter you are reading, which is longer and takes more time to accomplish. So, with all else constant, I will try a bi-weekly schedule this June and see if this improves my writing life. I will update you next month.\nThe Los Baños Internment Camp and a Lesson on Kindness #During this intentional improvement of my writing and walking life, I came to a serendipitous find. I have lived in Los Baños for over a year but know almost nothing about its local history. From a conversation I once had with a friend, I learned that it was once a hospital town. I compared this to Baguio’s history as a colonial hill station, a place where worn-down Caucasian men went to rejuvenate their life energies back during the American occupation. Los Baños is similarly colder. It is nearer nature, has a state university, and a respectable ex-pat community. Was it an important American colonial territory? How important? I don’t know, so I wanted to find out.\nI am fully aware of how reading about the history of a place almost immediately transforms our relationship with it. When I read Cortes’ claim that the area between Manaoag and my hometown of San Jacinto in Pangasinan was once a thick jungle where bandits and outlaws used to hide, I never saw my hometown the same way again. I would ride my bike around and couldn’t help to think about that jungle she wrote about. We have trees in San Jacinto but no wilderness; everything was converted into agricultural land. I love my rice fields, but rice is nothing to trees. How I wish I saw those trees. I wanted to be surprised the same way. These surprises deepen our appreciation of place and our relationship with it. I was ready to level up my relationship with Los Baños. And the best way to do that is to go to the library.\nHowever, it wasn’t easy to get hold of local history in Los Baños, though. You need access to books, obviously, and with the pandemic, going to the UPLB library is not without friction. I went the first time only to find out that I needed to book a chair online. I did that first, got approved, and returned the following day. While at the Filipiniana section, I was prohibited from searching for any book by myself. Instead, the librarian asked me for a specific title, something I didn’t have because the library’s online website was broken, and I couldn’t search for books there beforehand. So, I just asked the librarian to give me any books they have on Los Baños’ local history. He gave me three books, all of which covered a single story: the rescue of prisoners in the Los Baños Internment Camp.\nI picked up the first one, The Los Baños Raid by E. M. Flanagan, and read the first two chapters, which described the camp, how it started, and where it was located. I was surprised to learn that the half of Freedom Park from outside Baker’s Hall until the Fertility Tree and that area along Animal Husbandry, Copeland Gym, and some parts of Viado Street were once part of an internment camp for Western or Caucasian foreigners imprisoned during the Japanese occupation. More than a thousand prisoners were in that camp; many starved to death from 1942 until the remaining were rescued by American forces in 1945. According to Jeff, my friend who is a history professor at UPLB, the liberation of the internees was successful. However, it led to the massacre of Filipino residents living near the campus by the Japanese. My reading hasn’t gotten that far yet, although I would say that this was an expected reaction from the Japanese. It is typical for wartime Japanese soldiers to violently channel their anger toward prisoners and their colonies whenever they faced a defeat.\nMap of the Los Baños internment camp I took a picture of the map of the internment camp and, after leaving the library, walked these parts of the campus to trace the map and figure out what current markers could correspond to those indicated in it. I have repeatedly walked on these parts for more than a year, but they never meant that much to me until I read the stories inside that camp. Soon, I’ll be writing an essay about the camp and my attempt to trace it on that afternoon walk. But for now, I wanted to highlight the most important message I took home after reading about the life inside the internment camp. “When our freedom is crippled, we should respond with kindness.”\nThis lesson is best exemplified by an account of one Mrs. Nash:\nAs the fall of 1944 approached, my breast milk was failing, and were all developing the stiff, aching joints of beriberi. Death lurked close now. Roy, his head pathetically larger for his shrunken little body, had scarcely enough energy left to cry. They boys, slumping against the barracks wall for support, talked weakly and endlessly about food.\nBy Christmas, I had all but given up hope. All real nourishment for Roy was gone. For once, not even the skipper could think of anything to say. I know now it was because he was making his big decision.\nThe next morning I was standing wearily in the water line, Roy in one arm and clay jug in the other, when the skipper walked up and handed me a newspaper-wrapped package. “For the wee one,” he said casually. “I’ve been saving it for him.”\nIt was a while can of powdered milk, saved from the one Red Cross shipment that had got through to us more than a year earlier. It was enough to make a gallon of strength—two gallons the way we diluted it. “No, Skipper,” I stammered. “You’ll need it yourself.”\n“Never touch the stuff,” he said gruffly. He looked at Roy for a long moment, then turned away. In tears I called after him, “How can I ever repay you?” Half-jokingly he called back, “Just play me ‘Danny Boy’ at your next concert.”\nOn New Year’s Day I made a last feeble effort at giving a recital. Skipper didn’t show up to take the front-row camp chair I had reserved for him. Omitting encores, I rushed to the infirmary—too late. Hugh Williams was gone. The prison doctor said he died from acute colitis. “An all-milk diet might have saved him,” he added.\nThis bead of kindness that dripped out from that internment camp while evil happened inside and around it still floods the campus and overflows out into the streets of Los Baños, decades after the liberation of the internees.\nEarly this month, after meeting two friends at Haraya, I saw that woman once again who single-handedly feeds all the stray cats at Batong Malake. I see her all the time whenever I start walking by 5 pm. I was always curious about her but always felt shy to approach her. After telling my friends about her, one of my friends said we should approach her, so we introduced ourselves. We learned that her name was Ate Nadia (if my memory does not fail me). When asked whether she is part of an organization, she said no; she was doing this all by herself, buying cat food using her money, which she earns from an entire day’s work as a housekeeper. Every so often, there are too many cats to feed that her wage isn’t enough. When this happens, she asks for a favor from the nearby pet food vendor and borrows some pet food. When asked whether she has cats at home, she said a lot! She rescues some really young and vulnerable ones and brings them home where she can help them grow or get better.\nWe were all awestruck after hearing this. Here’s a woman—thin, poor, and old—who makes way less money than all of us and yet tirelessly walks the streets of Batong Malake every single afternoon to do what no one else wants to do—to feed the hungry ones. But I was not entirely surprised. I have seen this before. Not long ago, while walking along Cubao, I saw a boy feeding a family of stray cats: a mother and a few tiny kittens. The child was also living on the streets, and the food he provided perhaps came from the same food a kind passerby may have given him. Why does kindness arise from places that we least expect it to appear? These outliers break Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. They transcend themselves, they forget themselves in the service of others, and they amazingly do so while they are still hungry, unsecured, and unhealthy.\n“Thank You for Visiting Me” #I mentioned above that trial and error is an effective way of finding strategies of living that work for us. But kindness, I find, is something that works all the time. You don’t need trials and error to know that it is effective. Among all the strategies of living, showing kindness is the most enduring. Another meeting with a stranger this month validated this for me. It showed me that at the end of it all, nothing matters but the kindness we receive from others.\nOne afternoon during my second trip to Lopez, Quezon, we visited one of the patriarchs of Sta. Teresa—one Lolo Aldo. He was a Pangasinense like me, and my companions thought it would be nice for Lolo Aldo, now in his 90s, to speak with someone who speaks his childhood language again. Lolo Aldo lives in his house near the fishponds that now belong to his son, who lives with him temporarily, that is until he is gone. We all went to see the patriarch, but not everyone stayed long. His room was too small, and urine stench filled the air—that stench which seemed to say, “I can no longer control my body. I am losing control, and there is nothing, absolutely nothing, I can do about it.”\nThe windows were open. They were large windows, and outside, the fishponds sat in silence while the hills behind them watched. The patriarch talked very softly, so I had to come closer. “From where were you in Pangasinan?” I asked him. “Maasin,” he said. I remembered that Maasin was also a railroad barangay in Mangaldan, Pangasinan, much like Sta. Teresa, where he currently lives. Perhaps as a young man, he would ride the train just outside his house at Maasin, travel for an entire day or two, then get off at Sta. Teresa, where he would engage with whatever his trade was and eventually build a family there. We talked a lot about many things, but two things struck me. First, when asked what food he would like us to cook for him, he said nothing. Silent, he doesn’t seem to care. What goes in his mouth doesn’t seem to matter anymore. He has reached that point in one’s life where the taste of food is completely irrelevant, and food is no longer for pleasure but a tool to sustain one’s life force. Second, after trying and failing to ask him what food he wanted, he uttered these words, which I will never forget.\n“It is near. I can feel it. It is near. The end is near for me. But thank you so much for remembering me. Thank you for visiting. I am tired. I will now get back to sleep.”\nThey helped him back to his pillow, and we all left the room.\nA view of Lolo Aldo\u0026rsquo;s fishpond at Sta.

Kung ano ang iniisip ng tao tungkol sa sarili niya, iyon ang magpapasiya, o sa halip magpapahiwatig, ng kapalaran niya.”\nPagkatapos, tinanong ng tagapanayam si Gros kung kung meron ba siyang isang pananaw sa sarili niya na kasalukuyang gumagapos sa kaniya. Matagal nanahimik ang pilosopo. Pagkaraan ng ilang minuto, sumagot siya: “Tinuruan ako ng mga librong isinulat ko kung paano umunawa, pero ang problem ay kung ano ang ikinubli nila mula sa akin. Ikinubli nila kung paano mabuhay.”\n“Sa tingin mo ba mas magandang maglakad na lamang kaysa magsulat ng isang libro tungkol sa paglalakad?” tanong ng tagapanayam.\n“Oo. Subalit, wala akong sapat na lakas ng loob.”\nMay maliit na pipit na kumakanta sa tuktok ng maliit na puno pagpasok ko sa Doña Aurora. Kumakanta ito habang papalapit ako sa kaniya. Sa mismong sandali na tumapat ako sa puno at lumingon sa kaniya, umipot ang ibon. Mga ganitong bagay lang naman ang matututunan mo kapag naglalakad ka sa labas.\nSa dulo ng lakad ko, sa kalye ng Heliconia, may maliit na asong tumatahol sa akin. Nakatali siya sa tapat ng isang maliit na bahay na maakyat lamang gamit ng maliit na hagdan. Tumigil ako sandali at bumulong sa aking sarili, “Isa itong kakatuwang pangitain.”\n","date":"5 June 2022","permalink":"/lilim/028/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 028 — Ang Heograpiya ng Buhay"},{"content":" Here I am this morning, sitting on my office chair, looking at the gleaming leaves of a thin tree growing outside my window, covering my view of Makiling with a green translucent mask.\nI am uncertain whether it is even appropriate to call this a “tree.” Its kind just grows whenever the rain comes. We\u0026rsquo;ve had lots of rain in the past few days and boy do these \u0026ldquo;trees\u0026rdquo; grow fast! The owner of the piece of land outside my window had them cut a few months ago. Now they’re back with vengeance, blocking my once picturesque view of the mountain.\nI am in a mild trance looking at the green light when all of a sudden, I see a bubuli crawling around the branches of the tree. At first, the sun skink seems to be going down this one thin branch. But then it goes back up the same branch, as if it realizes that it is going the wrong way. Before it even reaches the tip of the branch, which is too small to carry its weight, the bubuli relocates into a leaf stem. The leaves of this tree are large, but they are less thick than the already thin branch that holds the bubuli. And yet, it feels like the creature is so sure that the leaf stem will be able to carry its weight. It proceeds without any hesitation or fear. Talk about lizard brain!\nFrom the leaf stem, it is only a few seconds before the bubuli reaches the large leaf, where there is no stem to support it. Naturally, its weight pulls the lighter leaf, which starts to bend down. At the exact moment when the bubuli would have fallen from the leaf, the animal jumps acrobatically to where it is really going—the sturdier trunk of another tree. It crawls down fast before I can even blink my eyes.\nWhat did I just see?\nIn her masterpiece A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Annie Dillard shared that when she was six or seven years old, she would hide pennies under the roots of trees or inside the holes of sidewalks just for fun. She would draw arrows that point toward the pennies and write a label like \u0026ldquo;SURPRISE AHEAD.\u0026rdquo; She never returned to these pennies and didn\u0026rsquo;t care who would receive them. “A free gift from the universe\u0026quot; is what she called them.\nThen she draws the following comparison:\nThere are lots of things to see, unwrapped gifts and free surprises. The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous hand. But—and this is the point—who gets excited by a mere penny? If you follow one arrow, if you crouch motionless on a bank to watch a tremulous ripple thrill on the water and are rewarded by the sight of a muskrat kit paddling from its den, will you count that sight of a chip of copper only, and go your rueful way? It is dire poverty indeed when a man is so malnourished and fatigued that he won’t stoop to pick up a penny. But if you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted in pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days. It is that simple. What you see is what you get.”\nWhat Dillard is proposing is to develop a humble eye—humble enough to treat small moments of surprise with gratitude and possibly even reverence. This is because, compared to peak experiences that are very rare, these simple, ordinary moments, which Abraham Maslow calls “plateau experiences,” are abundant. They are always here, always around us, if we only care to look.\nThese plateau experiences, these surprises, are more reliable sources of inspiration both for times when we need to create or times when we just need to go through a tough day. They are the pennies that a generous hand has left for us to pick up if only we care. And that is the point. If only we care.\nFor Dillard asks, “Who gets excited by a mere penny?” No one. Almost no one. Everyone wants the big things in life. Everyone wants fireworks—extravagant experiences. Meditators revere samadhi or kensho—the deep self-forgetfulness. Writers worship the rare flow of inspiration. Everyone wants the divine. Almost no one wants the ordinary, the mundane, the earthly.\nBut the big things are big for a reason—there are only a few of them. Few can afford expensive experiences. Few reach samadhi and kensho. Eureka is rare. There is no assurance we can ever get any of them. To rely on the big things for happiness and fulfillment is to set ourselves up for inevitable frustration. And this is while we are surrounded by pennies—millions of them, hidden in plain sight, all under our noses. The air we breathe. The sweet taste of watermelon on a hot day. The sight of little ants on a crooked line. “The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous hand,” Dillard says. “The world is in fact planted with pennies.”\nIf I pick all of them up, I might go home one afternoon with a good thousand in my pocket. But the key is that I have to be poor enough to do this. Otherwise, I wouldn’t care. And that is what Dillard admonishes us never to become: to never get too rich and too proud to crouch and pick up a penny.\nThat bubuli, who generously graced me with its presence on this cold and crisp Sunday morning, was one of Dillard’s pennies—an unwrapped gift from the universe.\n","date":"31 May 2022","permalink":"/lilim/027/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 027 — An Unwrapped Gift From the Universe"},{"content":" Are we going to lose another dirt road? It looks like it. Not a single tree was left standing on what used to be a heavily canopied path. It took me so long before giving this trail a try. But when I did, I found the solitude I was looking for.\nThe path was less used than the dirt road that led to it—the dirt road that connected Carusocan and Botao, two remote barangays of Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan.\nThe Botao–Carusocan road is too narrow. Two motorcycles would fit on it, but not two tricycles. When a tricycle comes, I get out of the way, carrying my bike and standing on the grass below the road. Today, no tricycle passed by.\nThis dirt road is not entirely made of dirt. Half of it was already cemented, which means it will only be a matter of time before its other half follows. In the rural Philippines, builders intermittently concretize roads—this segment for this year; that segment for next year. Occasionally, it could take up to six years before an entire route is fully concretized; that is because we have to wait for the next elections to elect the leaders who would hopefully finish the project. I find this waiting period blissful and sad at the same time. Blissful for the few more chances to feel the dirt on my feet. Sad because time is running out.\nThe canopied dirt road is not as busy as the Botao–Carusocan road. Almost no one uses it. I once thought it was just a short road that ended at someone’s house. When I finally walked it, I was surprised to discover that it was twice as long as the Botao–Carusocan road. I walked it intermittently at first, cautiously, fearing where it really led because it was not on the map.\nOne afternoon, I left my bike at my parents’ house and decided to walk all of it. I started around 3:00 in the afternoon with a backpack that carried my umbrella, a water bottle, and some money. The dirt road led to some houses, some wide pasture lands, and at the end of it was a Catholic walking garden—stations of the cross—which made me surprisingly happy. Again, none of these were indicated in Google Maps. Only locals knew about this road. But that will soon end.\nAs I walk it again today, now with my bike trailing beside me, I see iron structures lying on the corner of the fields, lower than the trail. Someone has parked a Hitachi excavator at the tip of the trail\u0026rsquo;s second segment. It has already flattened both parts of the road. They are obviously going to cement the path and turn it into a farm-to-market road. The irrigation canal will be next. For farmers, it is about time. For walkers like me, so long to you, friend.\nAs I walk, I see a massacre of trees, some probably 10–15 years old. On top of one cadaver, a pied fantail perches. I walk past it. It senses me and flies low over the short grass. Nearby, a devil\u0026rsquo;s needle dragonfly hovers over what little water is left on the canal. Summer must have been tough. Will the devil’s needle bring the trees\u0026rsquo; souls to the afterlife?\nWhen you clear a piece of land covered with trees in the province, you will find underneath them what they have covered their entire life—sachets, diapers, and oxidizing plastics. With them, the fallen trees—their roots, twigs, branches, leaves—are all just garbage polluting the land. As I look at this mess, someone starts singing Masdan Mo Ang Kapaligiran on the karaoke.\nI look in front of me, and I see some cows grazing on dry grass. Nearby, goats are eating fresh grass. Above me, a kite hovers—a black kite, almost like a lawin. Beneath, some young boys are running around. One of them was just standing, pulling the kite as he stared at it above.\nI continued walking while looking down at the stones, dust, and soil left on this dirt road. These will all be gone soon. Memories came my way—memories of all them dirt roads I walked before. I remembered my favorite dirt road in Sta. Maria, the snake road﻿. I remembered how I spent its last days, how I grieved as I witnessed people flocking spots where I once lied down under the stars, Tiktoking on points where I birthed some poems﻿.\nNot long after that road was concretized, I left Sta. Maria for Los Baños.\nThe pied fantail is back. It now perched on a branch of a small tree that was spared. It ruffles its tail with that delicate motion I find fascinating.\nI stop walking. A poem is coming my way.\n","date":"23 May 2022","permalink":"/lilim/026/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 026 — All Them Dirt Roads"},{"content":"I walk out the door and immediately feel the heat sting. A huge rain cloud is forming in the southwest, but the rest of the sky is azure.\nAt Carabao Park, I look up at the trees, and they all feel strange to me. I am in awe, and yet I know none of them. Is this what the ancient animists felt as they bowed beneath these giants?\nIt isn’t easy to love that which we cannot name. And it is even more difficult to love that which cannot talk because it cannot tell its story. And we need stories to understand someone. Without stories, I wonder how we can ever love trees, mountains, birds.\nIt seems then that the natural sciences is the language through which we can uncover these stories. A jump-off point for conversing with the natural world. Through science, we observe plants, animals, rocks, soil—all non-speaking entities—to understand where they come from, what they want, where they are going. They talk through their actions, through non-human sounds, and we interpret them by deducing the patterns they create. When I walk and see that the kapok has stopped producing new cotton, and those that fell are melting under the sun, I know that it was done colonizing open areas, and summer is closing soon.\nPerhaps this is why Thoreau and Dillard cared a lot about the natural sciences as much as they loved poetry. Through the natural sciences, they established that familiarity with the subject of their writing. They were able to call plants, animals, and even geographic locations by their names. And with calling them by their names comes the possibility of real connection.\nThe natural world talks by simply being itself. It speaks by moving, doing what it has to do. Thoreau and Dillard listened through their eyes, ears, tongues, and hands with the lens of science and, from there, responded through poetry.\nBut the natural world does not understand the language of man. It does not understand poetry. It only understands the language of action. So when Thoreau and Dillard heard nature and responded through poetry, they were not really talking back to nature. They were talking to their own kind.\nNature then is perhaps Deaf. It does not speak words. It speaks through signs. Its language is visual. It makes sounds, but looking at it is enough to get what it is saying. A flower blooms, and you know soon its seeds will burst. It wants to give birth, to continue life. And nature comprehends signs, too, comprehends kindness.\nYou can talk about conserving nature nonstop, but nature won’t understand you until you strike a stick to the ground to support a dying plant. Nature talks through actions, listens through actions—actions which Thoreau was not prepared to perform at his time. As he developed his listening to the natural world, he also grappled with questions on vegetarianism and environmentalism. John Muir would be the one to take what Thoreau heard from nature and respond through actions that reverberated through generations—actions that nature finally heard.\nThe sound of the palm leaves shaking is like water falling. I say goodbye to the trees and move on.\nThe view of Molawin creek from above the never-ending bridge is never-ending beauty. If there ever is a curator of rocks, this part of the creek was curated. At 4 pm, the rocks are photographic. The light that pierces the canopy of trees touches the rocks gently, and the water sparkles from afar.\nAlong the rocks, the water flows fast. A mini rapid. Then it weakens as it reaches a large pool, the part of the creek below the bridge itself, which is deeper, rockless. Here, the water rests as if it was its home.\nOccasionally, the water crumples. Either something from above falls or something from below moves. Whatever falls, I do not see. Whatever moves below is a mystery.\nEverything here is silent if not for the occasional car and walker that passes by the bridge or the birds that glide from one tree to the next.\nI leave the bridge and walk for a while along the stoned path beside Umali Hall. I pick up a piece of kapok and sit down on one of the hall’s foundations.\nThis kapok is unlike the cotton I use at home. Silky, it feels like the comforters I covered myself with as I finished my thesis in Baguio. The seed around which it is wrapped feels like a dried corn seed. It even looks like it—a dark brown corn seed.\nThe kapok takes on the smell of whatever it lands into. As I pick it up, it smells like grass. Now that I hold it in my hand, it smells like the peanuts I ate at home.\nI remember Doji’s fur as I roll the kapok between my thumb, index, and middle fingers. It looks like Doji’s fur. It is as if someone cut the hair off one big Doji from heaven, and they all fell from the sky.\nI look at all of Doji’s fur around me. Some of them were already melted by previous rains. Some orange bugs seem attracted to the small clover-shaped plants that grow between stones where the kapok have fallen. These are tiny orange bugs. As I get up and continue walking the stone path, I notice bigger bugs—also orange—mating out in the open. They look like orange versions of that bug my mom used to hate so much back in Pangasinan. It bites you, and when it does, it leaves a small evil needle beneath your skin. This needle hurts so bad. Bad, bad evil needle.\nOn the bridge toward IRRI housing, the creek is difficult to see. The foliage is thick. But you can still hear the river flow.\nI read a few pages of Dillard’s book as I rest on the side of Drillon road. I raise my head, and I see an unknown bird fly. It vanishes behind a tree. A few seconds later, I hear the air roar, and a thin sheet of a white line appears in the sky. I watch it as it traverses endless blue.\nAs I walk back home, the cicadas sound a deafening siren. A black dog barks as it approaches me. On my face, the wind blows as the night weaves a mask of darkness with no eyes.\n","date":"19 May 2022","permalink":"/lilim/025/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 025 — A Mask of Darkness with No Eyes"},{"content":"Ang dakong ito ng Molawin ay himlayan\nng mga dahong nahuhulog na parang mga payong\nmula sa mga tarangkahan ng langit.\nDumarapo sila sa mabababang halaman,\nsa lupang pinaliguan ng batis,\npero madalas sa tubigan.\nMinsan, tumatabi sila sa mga bunga ng Roystonea regia\nna sa malayo\u0026rsquo;y aakalain mong mga tuyong dahon,\npag nilapita\u0026rsquo;y, mga mariposa pala sa kakahuyan.\nInaawitan ng Molawin ang bawat dahong namamaalam.\nSa ilog na ito, walang bangkang susundo sa kanila,\nwalang magsasagwan.\nKung saan sila dadalhin ng hangin,\ndoon sila raratay,\ndoon sila hihimlay.\nTignan ang orihinal sa talahardin.\n","date":"9 May 2022","permalink":"/buhian/bawat-dahong-namamaalam/","section":"Buhians","summary":"","title":"Bawat Dahong Namamaalam"},{"content":"I saw someone die. It was a Monday evening. April 4. A motorcycle accident. I was on my bike, about to buy food, when I saw a large crowd gathered just past the church, where they were holding a singing contest. Behind me, I heard the voice of a young girl singing a song I can\u0026rsquo;t seem to remember, drowning the cries of the middle-aged woman who was trying to punch a man standing beside a motorcycle. A younger man held her. Hugged her.\nIn front of them sprawled a body. Lifeless. No breathing. Blood spattered on his face, dripping on hot cement.\nI got off my bike and from afar, I heard a siren wailing. Blue and red lights flickered in the air.\nThe next morning, someone I knew died of diabetes complications. When I went home to continue reading Scott Barry Kaufman\u0026rsquo;s book Transcend, he started talking about death.\nOutdoors in Elbi, the ground was filled with kapok. April started out with me contemplating my inevitable mortality.\nEverything is Fleeting #Kaufman said that these \u0026ldquo;hopefully\u0026rdquo; occasional brushes with death are—surprisingly—good for one\u0026rsquo;s mental health. People who experience them, especially those who encounter them in aging, realize that what is truly important in life are not the ups, the peak experiences that are so rare and yet so venerated. What is truly meaningful are plateau experiences: The ray of light that enters one\u0026rsquo;s bedroom as the day starts. The chirping of birds at the park. A kiss from a toddler.\nThese experiences are less remembered than their more extravagant cousins. But this is the exact reason why they are more valuable.\nThis appreciation of the little things in life does not come easy especially when one is young and filled with unquenchable ambition. There is a need to go after things when one is in his early 20s. A restless itch to do. An itch that makes it unbearably difficult to stop. And when one cannot stop, we don\u0026rsquo;t expect him to notice what is there, around him. The bees jumping from one flower to the next are all but an invisible spectacle.\nSeeing the value of plateau experiences comes only after several brushes with death and suffering—experiences, which make one wiser.\nI love this description of wisdom in Kaufman\u0026rsquo;s book:\nWisdom tends to increase with age and is most common among those with high levels of openness to experience, the capacity for self-examination and introspection, a motivation for personal growth, and the willingness to remain skeptical of one’s self-views, continually questioning assumptions and beliefs, and exploring and evaluating new information that is relevant to one’s identities.\nThis skepticism, this continuous challenging of one\u0026rsquo;s strongly held views, this drive to seek the truth, are marks of wisdom. And here is where I see the real connection between plateau experiences, brushes with death, and wisdom: When one wants to see the world as it really is, driven by curiosity and truth-seeking, one easily realizes that everything is fleeting. Curiosity opens one\u0026rsquo;s eyes and lets one see the meaning behind all the deaths and suffering around.\nIf I have not been practicing meditation, if I have not been writing in my journal every day, if I have not been contemplating the meaning of life, I would have been there at the spot where that man died that April evening and would not have cared one bit about what it means to me or to those I love.\nThis practice of looking closer at things and then seeing their transience opens one\u0026rsquo;s eyes to their preciousness—preciousness that generates gratitude and awe. Gratitude for a gift that we never really asked for but was given to us. Awe for the realization that of the many possible existents, it is us who are breathing, here, now as if we were chosen. From all of these arises the motivation to live life as intentionally as possible.\nPart of encountering one\u0026rsquo;s mortality is realizing how little time one has to do what one needs to do.\nLast month, I bought this decent memento mori calendar. Memento Mori is Latin for \u0026ldquo;remember death.\u0026rdquo; Each square symbolizes a week of my life. Shaded squares are weeks I have consumed. Unshaded squares are weeks left for me to use if I\u0026rsquo;m lucky enough to reach 70. I am in the middle years of my life. If the universe is good, I can still have twice the weeks I have already consumed and some extra. What will I do with the remaining weeks of my life? That is what troubles me.\nIt is a question, that Paddleton, a film I watched this April and loved very much, answered beautifully in one simple scene.\nMichael and Andy were neighbors who became really close friends. Both lived alone. When Michael learned that he would die of cancer and that doctors could no longer do anything, he decided to take his own life via pills prescribed by a physician. He asked for Andy\u0026rsquo;s help, which led to a six-hour road trip to get the pills.\nA few weeks after the road trip, Michael and Andy were sitting on their couch, watching the same movie they watch every night when Michael suddenly spoke. \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;m ready,\u0026rdquo; he said. Andy turns to him surprised and a bit confused. \u0026ldquo;I want to go when I feel good. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to go when it\u0026rsquo;s hurting,\u0026rdquo; continued Michael. Andy bargains a little but Michael repeated firmly, \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;m ready.\u0026rdquo;\nAndy surrenders, looks back at the TV, looks up, gave a sigh, and said, \u0026ldquo;I should have took off from work. I should have took off. A month ago. We could\u0026rsquo;ve done more stuff. I wish I had done that.\u0026rdquo;\nWhere Are All These Things Going? #In one journaling session this April, I started listing the intermediate creative artifacts I regularly produce during my daily creative routine: permanent notes, field notes, quotes, narratives, translations, poems, vignettes, photographs, etc. Most of them are collected inside my Talahardin, my note-writing system. For some reason, the question came to me, \u0026ldquo;Where are all these things going?\u0026rdquo;\nI mean, what\u0026rsquo;s the point? What\u0026rsquo;s the point of accumulating all this stuff? That was when an even more important question arrived, \u0026ldquo;What do I really want to do with the little time I have left in this world?\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not like I haven\u0026rsquo;t asked this question before. It\u0026rsquo;s just that I have never felt the question this strong.\nThe most natural answer to this question, of course, is books. I have been fantasizing about writing a book since I was in grade school. Back then it was a graphic novel. I called it Ilaya, a fantasy story set in a high fantasy world of diwatas, inspired by watching Mulawin and Encantadia.\nBooks occupy a significant amount of space at home. I have collected books throughout my adult life. I read books for a living. I call myself a writer. Most of the people I admire are authors. There are lots of things I am unsure of in this half-filled life—but writing a book is something I am 100% sure I want to do before it all ends.\nAnd so, this month, after giving it much thought, I have silently declared to myself—and perhaps publicly declare here, for the first time—that I am starting a book project. A \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; book project. Not the ebook projects I did in the past.\nThis is good. I\u0026rsquo;m gaining traction just by making up my mind. This is bad. Where do I start?\nThe Book I Want to Write #The most natural start is to think about what kind of book I want to write, which is the same as asking what kind of writing I want to write.\nI journaled further on this and discovered that I wanted to give birth to beautiful non-fiction books with photographs that combine personal narratives, philosophical thinking, cultural references, and historical descriptions all situated in a specific geographical location. In short, given my wide and sometimes sporadic interests, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just write a book with a single lens. I need multiple lenses to write it. This will make sure that the book will be a fun project to commit to.\nI went back to those intermediate writing artifacts I mentioned above. Then I mapped out a workflow that turns them into blog posts, newsletters, then later, books. I also wrote about what needs to happen daily, weekly, and monthly which would give me more chances of producing a book. None is final at this moment, and I have to go back to the plan. But I have looked at this closely enough to convince myself that this really matters to me right now.\nTo think better about these intermediate packets, I transferred my entire Talahardin from Craft to Obsidian. Obsidian just gives me more freedom in managing my notes and it allows me to think better about them in a way that Craft, beautiful as it is, is not really designed to do. It was a good 1 and 1/4 years of using it but I am ready to use a better tool to help me focus on really embracing a writing life centered on producing books.\nBut even more important than the tool is the internal system that the tool follows. Because I would like to write stuff that mixed different kinds of material, I decided to categorize my notes into specific types using tags: #Narratives, #Quotes, #Poetry, #PermanentNotes, #Translations, #FieldNotes, etc.\nNature and Place-based Writing #After I finished setting up the organization system just enough, I started playing around with writing narratives. I wrote a vignette on the death of a tuko in my house. I wrote the piece in Filipino after receiving feedback from my girlfriend that I sound like myself more in Filipino. Of course, deciding on the language I use to write will always be a tough decision for me, given the three languages I speak. But writing more in Filipino has always been an option open for exploration. I need to try everything to really hear my voice on the page, and if that means limiting my readership to only those who can understand a certain language, so be it.\nI probed further on what kind of writing I wanted to bring to the world. I started drawing a creative family tree, something I saw first in Steal Like an Artist. I placed Thoreau at the center of the tree and then started looking for people I can connect to him. Emerson is obviously above him, although not the focal point of my tree.\nI found a book of tributes for Thoreau. It was entitled Now Comes Good Sailing—named after what was said to be his last words. There, I read an essay about Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s influence on E.B. White, the author of Charlotte\u0026rsquo;s Web. The essay was basically saying that Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s influence on White was mainly technical. Their sentence constructions do sound the same in some places, although Thoreau will always be more difficult to understand than White (except in his journals, where he writes more accessibly).\nI also started reading Annie Dillard\u0026rsquo;s book The Writing Life per recommendation by Craig Mod. While reading the first chapter, I noticed that she reads like Thoreau. Her writing is patches of everything: history, anecdotes, intimate personal perspectives. And so I Googled if there is any connection between her and Thoreau. Lo and behold, there is! Not just a tiny thread of connection but a strong tight rope. Turns out, Dillard read Emerson and Thoreau when she was young. As a master\u0026rsquo;s thesis, she wrote an analysis of Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s Walden. She even married Robert D. Richardson, Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s biographer! She loves Walden so much that her magnum opus A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, which I am currently reading, was her attempt of creating something like Walden—a poetic nonfiction book that ponders the deep questions of existence while at the same time deepening the meaning of a specific place. In her case, Tinker Creek, a body of water in the suburbs where she lived.\nHowever, unlike Thoreau, Dillard wrote her magnum opus while in a library. She wasn’t a naturalist. She was unemployed when she wrote the book. She went out to her backyard and converted it into a wilderness to such skill that people actually thought what she was describing was wilderness! And this is why I love her so much. She is much more relatable, her language much more contemporary than Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s. I see her as a conduit for me to understand Thoreau better.\nI am still in meta-learning mode—establishing my creative family tree and seeing the works I should spend time studying. That said, I know what I am looking for—books and essays about place and nature that talk about what it means to live and draw resources from history, culture, science, philosophy, and every possible source.\nFollowing advice from Craig Mod and Gabriela Pereira, I have started to build a reading list. To come up with a list, I started reading the first few pages and chapters of several highly recommended books:\nA Week at the Concord and Merrimack Rivers by Thoreau Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey The Living Mountain by Nan Shepherd A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard Walden by Thoreau These are books of nature writing but I am also studying the styles of place-based and travel writers like Bruce Chatwin. I found a collection of his essays Anatomy of Restlessness at Booksale and started reading the first two essays. If I changed Uman\u0026rsquo;s format this month, his essay \u0026ldquo;I Want to Go to Patagonia\u0026rdquo; was an inspiration.\nThoreau\u0026rsquo;s books are difficult to read, which was a surprise because I love his journal so much. It felt as if the person who wrote the books was entirely different from that who wrote the journal. Nan Shepherd\u0026rsquo;s book was too out of touch, but I might give it another chance later. For now, I shall finish reading A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek and Desert Solitaire.\nThe decision to read Dillard was a no-brainer. After reading three chapters of the ebook, I was sold. As I said, she is like a more accessible version of Thoreau, who writes the way I want to write. She could do better in terms of conveying philosophical insights in her work, but she tries earnestly and that is enough.\nMeanwhile, I decided to read Desert Solitaire after reading an excellent essay by David Gessner entitled \u0026ldquo;Sick of Nature.\u0026rdquo; In that essay, Gessner argued that nature writing in its current state has lost most of its original spirit present in books like Walden where a certain quest was the central theme of the work, while nature just happens to be the backdrop where this quest happens. Instead, most contemporary nature writings have been saturated by spiritual language that romanticizes nature rather than honestly depicts it.\nI love this essay. It sharpened my criteria for what to include in my reading list. The kind of nature writing I am looking for is exemplified by what Gessner described:\nThe best writing in this genre is not really \u0026ldquo;nature writing\u0026rdquo; anyway but human writing that just happens to take place in nature. And the reason we are still talking about \u0026ldquo;Walden\u0026rdquo; 150 years later is as much for the personal story as the pastoral one: a single human being, wrestling mightily with himself, trying to figure out how best to live during his brief time on earth, and, not least of all, a human being who has the nerve, talent, and raw ambition to put that wrestling match on display on the printed page. The human spilling over into the wild, the wild informing the human; the two always intermingling.\nGessner\u0026rsquo;s essay was enough to convince me to try Edward Abbey\u0026rsquo;s Desert Solitaire. I\u0026rsquo;m done with three chapters and really appreciate its down-to-earth voice. The book is also a collection of vignettes that come together to create a narrative. It gave me an idea on how to possibly write and organize a book: If I could write small vignettes slowly and bring them together in a way that creates a narrative, then I have a book.\nAside from these, I also plan to read A River Runs Through It by Norman Maclean (1976), The Rings of Saturn by W.G. Sebald (1995), and Riding Toward Everywhere by W.T. Vollman just to explore their styles.\nAs much as I wanted to read a similar book written by a Filipino, ideally also in Filipino, I haven\u0026rsquo;t found one just yet. I went to Mt. Cloud at Baguio to look for one but didn\u0026rsquo;t see any. The closest I saw was written by a foreigner who spent a year on an island in the Visayas. However, his writing was not what I was looking for. If you know of any such place-based writing set in a specific geographic location in the Philippines, which is brave enough to cross-pollinate personal narrative with other types of materials, ideally written by a Filipino, please send it my way.\nWhile reading all of these books about nature, a common practice among the authors emerged: Everyone described specific moments of deep observation of particular phenomena in nature. Thoreau and Dillard wrote these observations in their journals. I would wager that most nature writers keep field notes and journals. Because of this, I was inspired to go back to writing field notes during my walks, which I rewrite as vignettes in my journal. Here\u0026rsquo;s a recent example, which I wrote in Filipino:\nPababa na ang araw pero maliwanag pa rin. Maputlang kunti ang sinag nito. Hindi matapang na orange. Mainit sa balat.\nMay mga nahulog na mangga. Meron ding mga pirasong halatang binalatan. Kinain. Walang mga prutas sa mangga na nasa tapat ng mga ito. Galing ba ang mga ito sa puno? O nahulog ng nakabisikletang dumaan?\nMalamig ang simoy ng hangin. Kahit na hindi naman natuloy ang pinakaaasam na ulan kanina. Masarap huminga rito. Malamig at magaan ang hangin. Para akong hinihele.\nMay mga tanim na okra sa harapan ko. Pero tila napabayaan na sila. Nilamon ng mga gumagapang na halaman. Pinayuko. Malalaki at matatanda na ang mga bunga ng okra. Lupa na at hindi tao ang kakain sa kanila.\nAll of these. This intentional remembering of the shortness of my life. This commitment to write a book. And before that, to read my predecessors. I see all of these as a manifestation of courage. The courage to claim who one is.\nI am a writer. Not everyone will agree. But not everyone matter.\nThis is what I want to do. Probably not forever since I am more than this. But that\u0026rsquo;s okay. For now, I claim what I am sure of.\nEverything is fleeting. I have consumed half the number of my weeks. I might as well go out for a walk now, and come back home later to my office to write about it.\nWhat else should I do?\n","date":"6 May 2022","permalink":"/uman/004/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 004 - April 2022 (The Weeks Left)"},{"content":"If life is ultimately meaningless (i.e., [[thoughts/nihilism|nihilism]]), then it is ridiculous to take yourself too seriously.

First, you see it in the greenery. Plants and trees are flowering, yet leaves are also withering. Then you can feel it on your skin. You want to be outdoors longer than usual, but once out, you start complaining about the heat.\nWith this change in season comes this March dispatch of Uman, a monthly newsletter of changes, which I, Vince Imbat, have started to call “a monthly newsletter that documents what it means to pursue philosophy and contemplation independently as a way of life.”\nA mouthful. But don’t mind this description too much. Like summer, this too shall change.\nStudies #I spent the bulk of this month thinking about the question, “What motivates us, humans?” I was interested in the conscious or unconscious reasons behind our actions. Psychology holds most of the answers to this question, so I stayed there for most of March. However, I also reviewed philosophical answers that provide illuminating insights into this fundamental and practical question.\nPositive psychology vs. humanistic psychology #I was interested in the difference between two branches of psychology that study the brighter side of the human mind (i.e., how humans can be the best version of themselves) as opposed to the darker side (i.e., why humans are crazy). These two branches are positive psychology and, its older sister, humanistic psychology.\nI read “The History of Positive Psychology” by Jeffrey Froh, whose main thesis is that positive psychology owes a lot to humanistic psychology and yet distances itself from it. Froh argues that positive psychology can only “self-actualize” if it recognizes its humanistic past.\nI also read “The Humanistic Psychology–Positive Psychology Divide” by Alan Waterman. His main thesis is that the philosophical differences between humanistic and positive psychology are so deep that any attempt to reconcile them will be difficult if not futile. He suggests that each branch of psychology should pursue its own work separately. However, after reading the works of Scott Barry Kaufmann, especially his latest book Transcend, which I started to re-read last month, I conclude that it is possible, and perhaps even necessary, to combine insights and approaches from both branches to come up with a more complete understanding of the human mind.\nThe meaning of life #No study of human motivation is complete without thinking about purpose. For individual actions, the purpose is the articulated reason or intention. For a human life in general, the purpose is the large articulated motivation from which every single action draws meaning.\nTo think more about purpose, I re-read the last chapter of the book What Does It All Mean? to refresh me with the question of the meaning of life. I then started reading the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on the meaning of life. The entry made me realize that happiness, although important, is not the ultimate goal. But if error theory (the theory that absolute objective values do not exist) is correct anyway, then there actually is no ultimate goal whatsoever.\nTo help me think more about “ultimate goal\u0026quot; or “life purpose,” I read, for the first time, a portion of John Mackie’s book Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong. His argument is that this thinking that there is one ultimate good relies on the same problematic assumptions that moralists subscribe to—that there are absolute, universal values. Per the error theory, which Mackie himself authored, no such things exist. Therefore, we can still choose to direct our life toward an ultimate good, but we are making a grave mistake if we assert that this ultimate good is objective and absolute (i.e., everyone must live their lives according to it).\nIf I subscribe to the error theory in thinking about my life purpose, then I could choose any purpose now and change it anytime. This is possible because I have full control of my purpose—I rely only on myself in determining what purpose to live for. For the time being, my minimum viable purpose will be to self-actualize and transcend (i.e., to fulfill all my needs for security so that I could grow as a person and live my life in the service of humanity). This could change as I deepen my understanding of purpose and human motivation.\nWhile walking one afternoon as I was thinking about these ideas, I realized that I may have committed a serious mistake by equating purpose with meaning. Purpose is simply an answer to the question of why you are doing what you are doing. It is the reason behind an action. Meaning is the interpretation of an object, concept, event, or human life. When life is said to be “meaningful” it probably simply means, we can “say more” about it because it means more to people and that is possible because more significant things happened in that life. Both purpose and meaning are concepts, which mean they owe their existence to our mind. Both are contents and creations of the mind but are differentiated because they serve different objectives. One way of describing the relationship between the two is that by living with purpose (i.e., being very intentional about your actions and life in general), you create a more meaningful life.\nOn a similar tangent, I wrote a very fruitful note on the relationship between nihilism and approaching life with humor. While writing it, I re-read Austin Kleon’s article on the book, The Comedy of Survival.\nLife Management System #Inspired by my thinking about purpose and motivation this month, I realized that I need a more systematic way of tackling my goals. Through a journaling session, I wrote a draft of an outline of my life management system implementation. I then wrote a structure note for this. On that note, I articulated what my reviews are meant to do. Now, I just have to think really deeply about project management. This will be a study project for April or May.\nPhilosophy outside academia #For a day this month, I also reviewed my resources on doing philosophy outside academia. I re-read the Don’t Go Back to School chapter on Benjamen Walker, the radio host who taught himself philosophy. My most important takeaway from Walker is that grad school has a very specific way of learning that accommodates a very specific person—a specialist who focuses on a single subject. The more generalist and the adventurous learner will be judged as not good enough in grad school. I also learned from him that it is possible to learn a subject matter competently and even better independently outside academia. Lastly, Walker’s example is a great model for how public production and conversation (via radio and podcast) can become a very potent framework to learn philosophy independently and build a philosophical career of one’s own.\nI also read the Introduction of the book, which featured Kio Stark’s own experience of dropping out of grad school. She dropped out because the method of learning didn’t work for her and was boring.\nAfter this, I reviewed Steve Patterson’s career. I re-read an article that features an interview about how he approaches doing independent philosophy. His workflow of reading—shower + thinking—writing dump—revising was really interesting to me. I also watched his video on why he is not in academia and listened to a podcast interview of him talking more about how he does his work independently.\nAlong this line, I also re-read the first parts of Create Your Own Religion, which was inspired by my attempt to look for other examples of individuals who have pursued independent thinking.\nProjects #I didn’t accomplish a lot of work-related projects this March. Most of my projects this month involved spending time with family and loved ones, letting myself explore subjects that I fancy, and doing several walks. April will probably be different, but we’ll see.\nOthers #Walks #As I said, I did several walks this month, mostly two-hour- to half-day-long walks.\nEarlier this month, I walked around Baguio town to see what has changed in two years since the pandemic. Several restaurants of note that I had pretty good memories in have either closed or relocated. For example, The Forest House has permanently closed, while Cafe by the Ruins Dua was replaced by Silantro in its old location.\nTwo weeks later, I would go back to Baguio to accompany my cousin and her boyfriend. We would walk the newly renovated Baguio Botanic Gardens after paying perhaps the most valuable P10 ever per person. We then walked Session Road in the evening checking out the famous and now revived Night Market. People have flocked to Baguio as restrictions continue to loosen by the day.\nThe orchidarium at the newly renovated Baguio Botanical Garden After our day together, I would stay another day and spend half of it walking the Yellow Trail at Camp John Hay, which I haven’t walked since around 2017. I sat down under the pine trees and wrote a journal entry but had to look for shelter when started raining hard.\nAfter going home to Los Baños, I spent an afternoon walking inside Makiling Botanic Gardens. It was too large to walk the entire place for two hours. But management is too strict. Visitors cannot stay longer than two hours (even when I was just the only person walking inside that day!). I went down a branch of the Molawin creek, which flows inside the Gardens, then took some photos and videos while looking around at the large trees.\nGoing back home to Pangasinan for another five days, I discovered a new trail along Matic Matic to Maronong Road. It was a silent trail for about half of it (which I really enjoyed). Then the other half was occupied by houses. The following day, I walked the trail that forked out of the first half. That trail was silent too. I sat over dried grasses, masks off, for about half an hour while staring at the large rain clouds accumulating at the horizon.\nTravel #Aside from my trips back to Pangasinan and Baguio, I was fortunate enough to see Taal up close at San Nicolas, Batangas, a few hours just after it blew off some dust. The famed Mt. Makulot was also beautifully visible from that vantage point.\nThe view of Mt. Makulot from San Nicolas, Batangas As if I needed more Batangas, I spent a night and a day by the beach at Calayo, Nasugbu. Along the way, I got to see Tagaytay again after about what could have been a decade.\nAlbum of the month: Duran Duran’s Rio album\nFilm of the month: Knives Out\n","date":"4 April 2022","permalink":"/uman/003/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 003 — March 2022"},{"content":"February has faded. March has come.\nThis is Uman, a monthly newsletter of changes, now with a “logo-ish”—the tetragram for the word “change” (𝌡) from the Tài Xuán Jīng, chosen with no reason other than because it looks like a stout letter “U.”\nAnd that is what this newsletter is about—funny symbols—no, I mean… changes.\nI’m Vince Imbat, in case you have forgotten who is sending you these emails, and here are some changes I went through in my life this month.\nStudies #Thay and self-actualization #This month, I finished reading Thich Nhat Hanh’s extended biography. One of my favorite insights from reading about his life is his formula for true happiness: Understanding → Compassion → Happiness. I realized through him that outer work enhances one’s inner work and that inner work is genuinely just preparation for serving the world (or a small chunk of it), which heightens one’s experience of self-fulfillment. No one has genuinely finished their inner work without fulfilling their outer work.\nMy contemplation on the relationship of compassion and individual happiness coincided with my re-reading of Scott Barry Kaufman’s book Transcend, which explains his modification of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs in detail. The book argues that human beings can transcend pure self-preservation in pursuit of selfless acts, ironically making them truly happy.\nAside from Thay’s biography, I also read the 14 precepts of the Order of Interbeing and the moving poem “The Fire that Consumes My Brother.”\nThinking about Thay and self-actualization, I can’t help but think about my purpose. This month, I reviewed and rewrote my purpose and updated my mission statement.\nDefining my field #Perhaps, it is too late for me to do this. Still, as an independent creative, exploring my creative voice for so long already, mainly through writing and supporting myself as a freelance editor along the way, I only realized how important it was to articulate precisely the kind of work I want to do (or have been doing) just last year. I have been calling myself a writer for so long, but what kind and about what? With the Talahardin now fully working and some good writing habits under my belt, I started articulating who I was as a life worker last year. The process is not yet over, though.\nAs a sub-project to this more significant project of articulating my life work, I decided to spend some time this month researching what field of knowledge I see myself aligned with. I knew that I wanted to engage in some form of philosophy. I have dropped “spirituality” or “religion” as a field because I wanted to free myself from dogma as much as possible. I wanted to see things as they really are, independent of prior assumptions.\nBut I didn’t want to engage in pure academic philosophy. I wanted a philosophy that was practical and grounded in everyday life and individual experience. I wanted a philosophy that makes a human being better. So I searched for any field or area of work where contemplation and philosophizing are combined.\nIn my search this month, I ran into Ran Lahav’s article “Philosophical Practice as Contemplative Philosophy.” This article introduced me to the philosophical practice movement, which popularized the use of philosophy in counseling. It also introduced me to Deep Philosophy, which was Lahav’s reinvention of philosophical practice—a practice that proposes the use of philosophical text for contemplation.\nI was intrigued. Here was someone who seemed to be already doing what I was thinking about doing. I bought Lahav’s book Deep Philosophy and started reading it. It wasn’t too long, though, before I realized his approach puts an uneven bias towards contemplation and an almost complete rejection of careful abstract reasoning. Although his work provides an excellent jump-off point, it wasn’t exactly what I wanted.\nThis got me thinking more about this seemingly never-ending dichotomy between rationalism and empiricism as the ultimate source of knowledge. To help me better understand this distinction, I read more about it.\nProjects #Learn web development #I continued learning Dr. Angela Yu’s course The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp. Specifically, I deepened my familiarity with HTML. One of the biggest lessons I had about learning how to code is to know when to stop. It can be pretty overwhelming but addictive, so it is difficult to take a break or drop the project altogether. Coding (for me) is complex as it is not my natural way of thinking. So if I am going to do this more often, I have to learn how to be a more mindful coder.\nTalahardin #I found and implemented a solution to use a custom domain name for my Talahardin (garden of notes). Previously, I only linked to https://www.craft.do/s/DNUP0iZyULDr15. Now, you can access my notes at https://notes.vinceimbat.com/. It is easier to access the notes now as the domain name is easier to remember. I followed a solution by the friendly developer Zuo Lan.\nKaliskis na Ulap #Using the exact solution I discovered in using a custom domain name for my Talahardin, I created a custom domain name for my collection of Thoreau translations. The main website is still in kaliskisnaulap.com. But the translation collections are now accessible in: salin.kaliskisnaulap.com.\nMigrating vinceimbat.com from WordPress to Hugo #Since I am already confident with my basic website building skills using Hugo and I have found a way to use a custom domain URL for my Talahardin, I decided to start migrating my website vinceimbat.com from WordPress to Hugo. I successfully migrated everything using an exporter.\nAfter migrating, I wrote a new home page and about page using Dave Ursillo’s Story Shine process. If you have time, I would appreciate it if you let me know what you think about these pages.\nLilim #After migrating my site to Hugo, I included some new content. Lilim, my now archived newsletter, has its second season fully uploaded to the site. I also added a previously unpublished season 1 issue, Lilim 01(05) — Autonomy Makes a Long Life, a fully updated account about the free birth process of a couple I was privileged to meet last year.\nOthers #I turned 30 this year. I feel sooooo old. But in a good way. I feel more confident about myself now—something I didn’t have when I was in my early 20s.\nMore good news: Provincial buses bound to Northern Luzon continue to open up, and travel seems to ease up even to unvaccinated passengers. I was able to go home to Pangasinan and spend time with my parents, who are getting older by the day. As I am writing this, my mom may just have gone through a procedure that might save her rapidly deteriorating vision. She has diabetes.\nAlso, I finally saw my nephew and niece for the first time since March 2019 and my other new niece for the first time ever.\n","date":"4 March 2022","permalink":"/uman/002/","section":"Umán","summary":"","title":"Umán 002 — Febuary 2022"},{"content":"Hello.

In recent years, I used three questions to guide my review:\nWhat went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What am I working toward? I picked these questions from James Clear.\nLast year, I added a fourth:\nWhat did I learn this year? In 2021, I learned a lot about building a life management system that I decided to use an entirely different template to write this review. This article is the culmination of a week-long process of reflecting on the past year and the aggregation of tiny reviews I did throughout 2021.\nThe process goes this way:\nI use five major life areas to review (life system, physical health, mental health, relationships, sustenance, life work). On each life area, I review the goals I set last year and review whether or not I accomplished them and why. Then, I share the other goals and projects that emerged throughout last year on that particular area. Finally, I share the new goals I set on each area. Let’s dive right into it.\nLife management system #Develop life system and philosophy. Setting this goal in 2021 was me telling myself I want to pursue philosophy. I want to use my mind and life as the center of my life work. Little did I know that a life system—which I now more accurately call a “life management system”—is an intricate thing built slowly. A life philosophy is even more complex as I need to continue to ask myself whether or not such a thing is even needed to live a good life. This is a goal I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to achieve in 2021 nor will I achieve it in 2022. It is a work for a lifetime. What I was able to do this year was articulate the concept of a life management system better and try things out for myself. One of these is establishing a note-writing system.\nEstablish a note-writing system and develop at least 300 fully developed notes. This was perhaps my biggest achievement in 2021. I was able to establish a minimum viable zettelkasten system and practice I modified and called Talahardin. This system also involved establishing a daily note-writing practice, which I was able to consistently perform most days of the year when I wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. I continued to dedicate time practicing, using, researching, and improving this system. That said, I wasn’t able to arrive at 300 notes. I am currently below 200. I realize along the way that the system will inevitably grow in size, but it should happen organically and there has to be a premium on quality over quantity.\nOverall, I am happy about what I achieve in this area. This area is perhaps the area I really worked on last year that I am quite surprised I am only able to list three achievements here. This only shows that building a life management system takes time and dedication, and the process for getting it right is something we cannot hasten.\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\nI was able to improve my digital security this year. This was a reaction to a card fraud event that happened to me in 2020, which was, thankfully, averted. I took action in securing my digital passwords, installing a VPN, and purchasing an antimalware software. My goal for this area in 2022 consists of one thing:\nI want to articulate my purpose, values, and big picture vision for my life to make it easier for me to make decisions. Physical heath #Get to normal weight. Entering 2021, I set a goal to achieve a normal weight dropping from 192.7 lbs to 178 lbs in the first quarter. This meant losing 14.7 lbs in about seven weeks. I failed terribly in this goal. Not only did I not achieve my goal, I even increased my weight at the end of the year. By December 31, I was 196.4 lbs. I tried to implement good eating habits when I transferred to Los Baños earlier this year and that actually led to the lowest and closest weight I had to my goal on March 27, 2021. That day, I weighed 182.5 lbs—4.5 lbs short of my goal. From that day, however, I increased my weight, decreasing once more around June but increasing around October. Maintaining a healthy weight is difficult and I seriously need to do more reflection on what worked or did not work for me in this project.\nPrevent LPR onset. LPR stands for laryngopharyngeal reflux, a condition where acid and contents of the stomach return to the esophagus and throat where they wreak havoc. I suffered from LPR in 2020, which was the original impetus for losing weight. In 2021, I was determined to prevent another relapse so that my throat could heal. I had several LPR relapses, but nothing serious and by about November to December this year, I almost can\u0026rsquo;t feel the tear in my throat. I was definitely able to improve my digestion through avoiding unhealthy foods, eating more probiotics, especially yogurt, and taking supplements like essential enzymes and pepsin.\nHeal eardrum perforation. I would admit that among the health goals I set last 2021, this was the most difficult and perhaps even impossible. According to studies, there is a very slight chance that an adult’s eardrum with a large perforation caused by infection would heal back on its own. But due to the possible complications of the surgery, one of which is the possible worsening of my tinnitus, I chose to wait and delay. I was already habituating to my tinnitus that I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the need for surgery for it to get better. I was afraid to make my tinnitus worse that I could not habituate to it so I opted to wait and see if the eardrum heals back. My goal was to only help heal my eardrum to close to about 75%. I was only able to heal my eardrum back to about 50%.\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\nI was able to establish a daily walking habit early in January 2021. This was to compensate with the bike rides I used to have in Pangasinan. Walking not only became my main form of exercise; it has now become an integral part of my life work. I was able to establish a simple system for purchasing and cooking my own food. I learned several recipes myself. It isn’t perfect though, and I need to do a better job eating the right food. Overall, my intention entering 2021 was not to have a serious health issue as I experienced in 2020. Although I am not yet fully healed from all my health issues, I enjoyed a generally healthy existence throughout 2021, so I think I succeeded in achieving the general standard of this life area.\nMy main physical health goals this 2022 are:\nTo establish a better sleeping habit (eight hours a day from 11 PM to 7 AM). To establish a healthy, sustainable, time-efficient, and cost-effective nutrition system that will improve my overall well-being. To have my throat completely heal. Mental health #Tapering antidepressant. This is a goal I was able to achieve. I continued to take half a pill of the only antidepressant I have been taking (sertraline) since my diagnosis in 2011 without experiencing adverse effects. I am ready to continue with the tapering and reduce my dosage further to a quarter of a pill for another year.\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\nAfter almost two months of surveying, I found the perfect apartment to settle in in Los Baños. Located in a quiet neighborhood, I am currently enjoying peaceful neighbors and fresh air at the foot of Mt. Makiling. This space has profoundly improved my mental health and creative energy. After settling it, I did my best to make the house liveable and established systems to maintain and manage it. It was challenging to maintain a larger space given that I was alone (with my cats). But I learned a lot living by myself. I have built a workspace that supports my creative work. I invested on a 24” monitor, a standing desk, and an ergonomic chair. These three are the best purchases I made in 2021. Overall, I am definitely happy with my general mental health. There were down days, of course. I usually feel blue during the start of the rainy season. But my mental health improved by a notch for two reasons: a nurturing environment and proximity to friends.\nMy mental health goals this 2022 are:\nTo further taper my sertraline dosage to 1/4 pill a day. To transform my simple abode into a welcoming home for the important people in my life—people who I invite for meaningful and transformational conversations and camaraderie. Relationships #Nurturing more relationships. This is an area of my life in which I think I made a lot of progress this year. I took the PERMA test when I got to Los Baños around the first quarter and compared it to my results from 2020 and I noticed a steeped rise in my happiness level due to a subjective satisfaction in my relationships. In Los Baños I was able to meet new friends and establish closer relationships with old friends. These relationships, in turn, challenged me and encouraged me in thinking about my life work and the life I want to build in general.\nBuilding relationships to help me in my life work. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to accomplish this because I realized early on that I have to articulate to myself first what kind of work exactly I want to accomplish. That will help me identify the exact people to connect to.\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\nI transferred to Los Baños, which profoundly improved my relationships. I have great neighbors, great friends, and I am closer to Lear while I’m here. I was able to make my apartment more welcoming to my new friends and hosted one event. While staying in my transient space, I was visited by two stray cats. I fed them and that is why they returned. I was simply reciprocating how LB people are treating their animals. When I was about to transfer to my new place, I decided to bring them with me. I am happy with my decision—although sometimes regret it when I call Champy and she doesn’t come. Speaking of pets, my oldest dog Doji died in Pangasinan while I was away. This actually prompted me to finally visit home after eight months. I decided to transition Kako, my other dog back there, to organic food to improve her health. More on pets: I learned how to solve a flea infestation after we had a bad one last November. I was able to make large strides in my relationship with Lea. I met her mom and relatives. I was able to introduce her to mine. Everything is really going well with the two of us. My relationship goals in 2022 are:\nTo help Lea be accountable to her goal of saving for her emergency fund. To support Lea in her goal of becoming her healthiest self. To articulate for myself clearly what kind of people I want to bring into my life and inner circle. To proactively search for my ideal people and nurture my relationships with them. To reunite my entire family at least once this year. Sustenance #Reviewing my beliefs on money. Early in 2021, I wanted to see if there are other ideas aside from those I learned from Your Money or Your Life and Early Retirement Extreme that could guide how I see personal finance. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to pursue this project because I focused on setting the foundation for the more basic and obvious changes in my current resource management system.\nRestructure my resource management system. I call it a resource management system instead of a financial management system because I see that the non-financial materials that we use in our lives are tightly connected with how we use our money. In 2021, I put a lot of time into setting up the foundation for a better system. First, I transferred all my emergency funds to online banks, which have higher interest rates than normal banks. Bye, bye BPI and EastWest. Hello CIMB and Tonik! Next, I learned passive investing and invested the majority of my savings to both the Philippine Stock Market and the international stock markets. I\u0026rsquo;m totally new in the game, but I am happy to have started.\nLook for a second source of stable income. I was making enough money as a freelance English editor by the beginning of 2021, but the resilience thinking I learned from reading ERE convinced me that I need to start or look for a second source of income that could compensate for my main source in the case, for an unforeseen event, that source disappears. Unfortunately, I was too preoccupied with the previous goal that I lost steam on this one.\nReconsider entrepreneurship to find sustenance work closer to joy. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to follow through with this goal because I was exposed to the patronage model many times in 2021: Andy Matuschak, Craig Mod, and Hundred Rabbits. I decided to explore the patronage model. I contemplated whether establishing patrons instead of a business would suit me better. I am convinced that it would, given the nature of the work I want to do. However, it seems a more difficult thing to build than a business and so I remain open to either.\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\nI studied insurance and bought myself an HMO card for the first time. I built my own financial tracker through spreadsheets and transfer my monthly financial review there. I started exploring the idea of outsourcing my editing work to someone My sustenance goals in 2022 are:\nTo create a budgeting system to use every month, while I haven’t yet improve my financial system. To reevaluate my understanding, values, and general philosophy of money and the material world. To reevaluate my editing work and decide whether to improve my editing skills or learn a new skill altogether. To reevaluate whether to outsource my editing work or not. To find a second source of stable income online. To invest in high risk, high reward investment instruments. To learn Linux and consider an opensource lifestyle. Life work #Connect with independent thinkers building their own philosophical systems. My transfer to Los Baños sucked me into the local community of artists and creatives. Although I enjoy our camaraderie, there is no denying that I need a community that is exactly parallel with the work I want to build (contemplation and philosophy). I was able to establish a friendship with one such person in 2021, even started a dialogue with him. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Being an introvert, socialization is not really my strong suit and I need to exert more effort to put a dent in this goal.\nHave a first draft manuscript of my translation of Thoreau’s journals. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to achieve this goal. But I like it that way. Thoreau has been a profound influence on how I see the world and live my life that going back to his works and slowly doing the translation is the pace I want to take. I did manage to do many translations in 2021. But I will not force myself to release a book. I plan on building a site of my translations though (Update: I have done this! Check out the site at kaliskisnaulap.com).\nOther goals in this area that came to me this year:\nI was able to revisit all my past notes about my life work and uncovered important data on my tendencies and preferences. I have started to define my life work better. I am not completely there but I am making progress (link to notes on life work) In 2021, I commemorated the 10th year of my depressive episode—the single most life-changing experience I had. I released a series of vignettes about my episode, which I later discontinued. I released two seasons of a newsletter I called Lilim. It was the first newsletter I was able to consistently release weekly (except for twice I think). It was a newsletter inspired by my new love of walking, my never-ending philosophical questions, and my desire to improve my voice as a writer. I deepened my photography skills. I took a course in iPhone photography, joined Craig Mod’s membership club for a month, read the Teju Cole’s column in the New York Times, and went to lots of walks to take photos. I volunteered to document events and took portraits of my friends. Learning photography has been one of the most fulfilling experiences I had in 2021. I took lots of walks. Almost everyday, I walked. I discovered every little street in Los Baños and went to several longer walks discovering new places in town. My research on Zettelkasten, knowledge management, and life management has really deepen that I was able to create and conduct a workshop. My life work goals in 2022 are:\nTo study web design and create a new minimum viable design for vinceimbat.com. To study web development to apply the new design for vinceimbat.com. To learn coding. To continue translating a sizable amount of Thoreau’s journal quotes. To build a website for my Thoreau translations. To establish a regular habit of reaching out and conversing with my ideal audience: audience, peers, and mentors. To research individuals who asked the question “How to Live?” and have studied how they study, live, share, connect, and facilitate their ideas to others. To clearly articulate my Talahardin system using inspiration from Zettelkasten, Evergreen note-taking system, and BASB. To design a beta version of an app for my Talahardin. To plan, perform, and write about at least one long philosophical walk.

A yellow boat is docked on the tiny pier. That tint of yellow on the deck is special—brighter than the already dirtied hull. And that white roof—oh, good choice of color! Not only is it pleasing in the eye, but I also bet it’s cooler inside than most boats. But look closer. The tied is higher than usual, and there’s a new concrete on the pier, where there were once just rocks, lots of them. The lake is calm as usual. The sky calmer. Although cloudy. But they’re not too low as to cover the beautiful blue mountains in the background. Lea and I just sat there, feeding our eyes with all the colors, topping them all with the cool breeze that made tiny waves that hit the pier. It was getting dark and people were starting to flock around the newly built garden where we sat. A Chinese egret from nowhere flew very low in front of us. And then it was gone.\nA Thought #This is the last issue of Lilim for its second season. I am not sure if there will be a third season. I’ll be taking a break from sending newsletters.

In fact, We only think about purpose when we are existentially lost—something a child is incapable of doing simply because a child is incapable of being existentially lost.

Wood, trash, and all sorts of things were scattered along the beach. Kuya Frank was holding a mug of coffee. Most probably, instant. He offered me to get one for myself. There’s hot water, he said. I declined, told him I’ll drink mine while I have breakfast later. It was too early for breakfast, and the sea looked alluring—as if telling us to witness its grace this Monday morning.\nBut Kuya Frank doesn’t need convincing. He have seen the sea many mornings than he could count. And yet he looked at it still as if he was looking at it the first time. And then he started pointing towards the West. That’s Anilao, he said. We brought many divers there pre-pandemic. Now it’s close. And that’s Bonete, he pointed to an island over the horizon that looked like a round piece of bread. And that’s Calatagan. Fisherfolks from Calatagan still bring their fishes here at Lemery, where prices are higher. Perhaps, there is too much fish in Calatagan, Kuya Frank explained. I noted his supply and demand argument. It was flawless. If you catch 200-300 kilos of fish, that’s a good day, he said. If you can catch that much consistently in a month, you can easily pay for the costs of a big boat—Php 200k—plus Php 100k for the net. I was surprised by the cost of a wooden boat and its net. But that surprise was just a reflection of how ignorant I am—whose ancestors were Austronesian seafarers—about what it meant to live near the sea.\nThat’s when I realized I needed to ask Kuya Frank something. I excused myself to get my phone, returned, and showed him a picture of Thoreau’s mackerel sky, then asked, what do you call this sky? “Ah, kapag ganiyang may kaliskis na ulap, kailangan raw pumalaot sabi ng matatanda, at maraming mahuhuli.”\nA Thought #Working on smaller tasks creates a sense of control.\nWhen we break down our work into small and clearly separated tasks, it automatically becomes easier. This is because when tasks are small, it is easy to change course when necessary or just because we want to. This, in turn, creates a sense of control, which stirs us towards pursuing what we really are passionate about. If our work provides us with this sense of control, it becomes a source of motivation, which makes our work sustainable.\nA Quote # If my hands are fully occupied in holding on to something, I can neither give nor receive.\n— Dorothee Sölle\nA Question #What’s one thing you’re still holding on to that you should’ve dropped a long time ago?\n***\nThank you for reading.

When I arrived from Pangasinan last weekend, I could still take some decently lighted photos around 5:30 in the afternoon. Now, it’s completely dark by 6:00.\nAbout a few days ago, I was walking at UP around that time. I started my way along Victoria M. Ela Ave., stopping briefly to listen to some church music at the Diocesan Shrine of St. Therese of the Child Jesus. I’m not a Catholic. I just find church songs amazing. I then crossed the bridge over an arm of the Molawin river and turned right at Pili Drive. The plan was to reach Freedom Park through this route.\nAt Freedom Park, at the mouth of Manuel L. Roxas Street, there were no lights. Only shadows. There were some lights at the other end of the street. It was those lights that hit a big mass in the middle of the street creating a shadow that was impossible to ignore. When I saw it, I walked a little slower, trying to figure out what it was. Was it a big branch of a tree that fell? Was it a person? It was neither. As I approached the shadow, I saw that it was, in fact, a dog. Lying down, not moving, aside from its occasional breaths. My first immediate thought was to ask for help. But who? Of course, Cats of UPLB, who also feed the dogs here, and who probably know the dog. They replied. Turns out, the dog, whose name was Blanca (a boy), was missing during their feeding time that day. Volunteers from outside the campus went to UPLB, beating the 10 pm curfew, to feed Blanca. Good thing he ate and drank water, they said. They returned the following day to bring Blanca to San Pablo, where he is currently confined. If you’re interested in sending donations for his treatment, which is currently running beyond Php 6k, reply to this email and I’ll send you their donation lines. Alternatively, you may also check the Facebook page of Cats of UPLB for the donation lines and updates on Blanca’s health.\nA Thought #Freedom requires self-reliance.\nWhen you choose freedom over a middle man or a centralized power, you trade convenience with liberty. Being free is not easy, because when you don’t answer to anyone, you take full responsibility for your actions.\nA Quote # When we read someone else thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … Accordingly in reading we are for the most part absolved of the work of thinking. … It stems from this that whoever reads very much and almost the whole day, but in between recovers by thoughtless pastime, gradually loses the ability to think on his own – as someone who always rides forgets in the end how to walk. But such is the case of many scholars: they have read themselves stupid. For constant reading immediately taken up again in every free moment is even more mentally paralysing than constant manual labour, since in the latter we can still muse about our own thoughts. But just as a coiled spring finally loses its elasticity through the sustained pressure of a foreign body, so too the mind through the constant force of other people’s thoughts.\n— Arthur Schopenhauer\nA Question #What can you do to not lose your ability to think on your own?\n***\nThank you for reading.

We left Pangasinan around one in the afternoon and arrived in Calamba by five. I was in Los Baños by six, carrying a heavy backpack and another bag filled with books. I wanted to walk since, hey, I’m already in LB! But my luggage was too heavy to carry. I called a tricy to help me out.\nThe week-long vacation back in Pangasinan was a blast. I brought with me important insights I will be processing in the coming days, some of which I already shared in the previous issue. But in some way, I am also quite relieved to be back home in LB. “Covid peer pressure” was just too strong in Pangasinan.\nAll of my relatives have been vaccinated. All of them believe that the virus is the greatest most important enemy they will ever face in their entire life and that they need to do whatever it takes to protect themselves and their loved ones from it. I have many relatives in the medical profession, so it is understandable that they repeat what their superiors in the medical system tell them—the virus is bad! Get vaccinated! Lockdown everything! Fuck the anti-vaxxers! Wear masks everywhere! Forget fun and stay at home for 50 years or until this is all over!\nWell, I don\u0026rsquo;t share this enthusiasm. And I am not alone.\nI do not deny the existence of the virus. I just don’t think we are showing enough critical thinking about what medical authorities are telling us, especially with these drastic measures they are endorsing that are affecting the economy severely—something that, believe it or not, trickles down to the poorest members of society. And should I mention the toll all of these are taking on our collective mental health? How about the violation of our liberties, e.g., possibly being forced to put something in our body we are not even sure is safe?\nBut this isn’t at all surprising. We’re intellectually impatient. We don’t spend enough time thinking about our beliefs, reading enough about ideas that are different from ours. We choose what’s easy and most of the time, what’s easy is what\u0026rsquo;s on our social media feed. Unfortunately, these feeds are designed to confirm our own unchecked biases. And traditional media is not helpful either.\nWhen I think about all this covid mayhem, I feel like what I felt while I walked a nearby narrow farm-to-market road on my last evening in Pangasinan. The photo above captures what it looks like to walk by yourself, alone, in the middle of rice fields with only a small light to guide you.\nThese are frightening times. But I’m not sure what I should fear more—the virus or how unkind we seem to be to people who don’t share our beliefs about the virus.\nA Thought #Doubt is an important part of a rich life.\nWhen you doubt your beliefs, you start to listen to the points of view of others. You become more empathetic to your “enemies.” Artificial divisions are diminished and dialogue and conciliation can be more possible.\nDoubt has practical benefits as well.\nWhen you doubt your current job, you will start looking for other places that can make better use of your talents and strengths. Possibilities are opened. You become more connected to yourself and those you are meant to serve.\nDoubt is an important part of a rich life.\nDoubt is a space where we finally meet our true selves and those of others.\nDoubt leads to freedom, and freedom is a prerequisite to a happier existence.\nA Quote # What sort of life do we think we are protecting? There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two meters. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.\n— Jonathan Sumption\nA Question #How much freedom and quality of life are you willing to sacrifice just to avoid death?\n***\nThank you for reading.

A few days before that, I just learned the mechanics of cross-provincial traveling—the paperwork and rides—from a friend who has traveled twice during the heavier lockdowns. I took advantage of the opportunity—of less strict travel rules—to get out of Pangasinan and start a new life at Los Baños, Laguna.\nLeaving Pangasinan was something I have contemplated for years even before the pandemic. I grew up in Pangasinan and have stayed here for most of my 20s. But deep inside, I knew that I will not be staying here forever. For one, I will not raise a family here. There was just too much history in this place—wounds that are yet to heal, wounds that I will never outgrow as long as I was here. Despite knowing this, some things just kept coming up, which prevented me from building the confidence to start a new life far away from home—a painful breakup from a six-year-long relationship in 2018 and then the insanity-inducing advent of my tinnitus in 2020.\nI have played with the idea of leaving this place in my head for so long. The pandemic just made it clear to me last year that it was time. So, no matter how painful it was to leave everything—the view of the Cordillera, the calming green of rice fields, the slow motion of life in the province, the lake I frequented during the lockdowns, Doji, Kako, Chami, my father and mother, I left. And it was the right call. I am in a far better place now—a place more aligned to who I am, not yet perfect but perfectible, a good place to start.\nBut why did I came back? No matter the shadows we associate with places we grew up from, we cannot change the fact that at one point we stood upon them, and dug our roots, and sucked on the comforts of their soil. For me, it was the dogs that called me back. Doji died about a month ago—a day right after I thought about going home but decided not to because I was still enjoying the transition and didn’t want to destroy my momentum. But my mom and my dad, they too were calling—silently though, they’ve always been silent. In just eight months, they suddenly grew older, caught some health issues, and are now showing clearer signs that they won’t be here forever. My father was boasting his new senior citizen benefits.\nThe old home in Santa Maria is now abandoned. Don’t know if I’ll go there before I go back to Laguna next weekend. Probably. It’s something I can’t not do while I’m around here.\nThe photo above was taken in the new house my father has been building for several years now, in Santa Barbara, my mom’s hometown. This was where Doji died last month, and where Kako (in the picture) cried yesterday when she smelled my scent as I sat on one of the wooden benches behind her.\nA Thought #Do projects that target several goals at the same time.\nYou can only work on a finite number of projects at any given time (due to cognitive, physical, and logistical limitations).\nBecause of these constraints, a very wise approach is to choose projects that target several goals at the same time.\nTo do this, the following process can be followed:\nDefine all your goals. List all the projects you want to do. Compare projects and see if you can combine two, three, or more in such a way that one project fulfills multiple goals. An example of a project that targets multiple goals is walking. When I walk, I improve my physical and mental health. I commune with Nature. I could practice photography. Sometimes, I also get to meet people along the way and hear their stories. But most importantly, ideas and insights come to me when my limbs are moving. This is why I also call walking “fieldwork,” because it is what it is—an avenue for fulfilling multiple values and interests.\nA Quote # There are hundreds of paths up the mountain, all leading in the same direction, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter which path you take. The only one wasting time is the one who runs around and around the mountain, telling everyone that his or her path is wrong.\n— Hindu proverb\nA Question #What place is calling you to return?

Living with a cat, I find, is like “living in” with a fiance. Every day, or at least every week, you learn something new about her. And I think this familiarity is what ultimately builds the bond (and for some, what breaks it). This happens in any kind of relationship. I mean—isn’t it impossible for me to build a bond with someone I am not “familiar” with? Luckily, for a cat, especially a house cat living with a house person like me, this “familiarity” happens easily, naturally, so subtly I’m amazed it even happened.\nJust a few days after adopting Champy, I forgot to close the back door and she got out, never to come back until after two days. I feel guilty feeling this back then but a part of me actually felt good when she left—I mean, I “don’t know her”, I just thought bringing her in was a “kind” thing to do, but I never really knew her. I secretly said, “Good riddance. You don’t want to be helped? Then fine.” But she came back! All perched on the window like a large lizard with her four limbs stretched, meowing loudly as if explaining why she left. She left a second time about a month after this happened, and I was anxious for her to come back. Today, I’m sealing all windows, all doors, all holes around the apartment she might fit into. I might die if she gets out again never to return.\nFamiliarity is the foundation on which love can be built. I wonder how much of the hatred and fear existing in the world right now arises out of a lack of familiarity.\nA Thought #Organization is only possible because of the law of non-contradiction.\nOur mental ability to distinguish between this and that is called the law of non-contradiction. This law of thought was first articulated by Aristotle. It simply means that, for example, given that an apple and an orange have unique characteristics—then an apple and an orange are not the same.\nThe law of non-contradiction is so critical in living well. Without this ability, it is impossible to organize anything from the simplest atom to the most complex societies.\nWhile some would argue that organization is the antithesis of positive emotions—that we should just \u0026ldquo;go with the flow\u0026rdquo; and embrace the mess—I would argue that organization actually optimizes freedom—it allows us to free up mental space so that we can experience more positive emotions.\nAnd, again, organization is only possible because of our mental ability to distinguish between this and that—the law of non-contradiction.\nA Quote # The dynamic of friendship is almost always underestimated as a constant force in human life: a diminishing circle of friends is the first terrible diagnostic of a life in deep trouble: of overwork, of too much emphasis on a professional identity, of forgetting who will be there when our armored personalities run into the inevitable natural disasters and vulnerabilities found in even the most average existence.\nThe ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self, the ultimate touchstone is witness … to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.\n— David Whyte\nA Question #Who is one person you might actually like if you get to know them more?\n***\nThank you for reading.

I\u0026rsquo;m capping a week of living without Facebook and Messenger by communing with water. I am also going back to work tomorrow—another intense editing marathon for five days, which means no long walks in the afternoon, only short tours on the streets around my place, around 30 minutes—an hour if I am lucky. So I walked today. My pedometer computed 5,000+ steps from my home to the lake. I took the longer cut by using the inner streets to reach the highway rather than the main road. The walk is quieter that way. I try my best to avoid the noise when I walk. Actually, I try my best to avoid the noise wherever and whenever I can. It\u0026rsquo;s the only way I can give myself a chance to hear myself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the reason why I left Facebook and Messenger this week and honestly contemplating leaving them for good. There are things only heard in silence—usually the best things, the important things. And I heard a lot of that this week.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what exactly provoked me to leave. I just knew I can\u0026rsquo;t take it anymore. Was it the feed or the chat app? I feel like the latter has gone out of hand more than the former. The feed can be tamed by unfollowing people and no one would know. The chat app is an entirely different animal—rabid, too extroverted, too authoritarian. If you seenzoned people, they’ll get hurt; if you don’t even read their messages, they’ll get hurt; they want you to respond immediately. And it’s not their fault entirely. It’s just how the app was designed. We just follow how it was designed.\nCompare that to the silence you get from reading this email. I won’t know when you read this (until I check the report in Mailerlite). I don’t anticipate a response from you. I don’t get hurt if you seenzoned my email. No one is rushing anyone. No one is asking for anyone\u0026rsquo;s attention in real-time. This email can just be an ambient thing that passes through your attention and is deleted or archived after the experience.\nThis is how it was designed. This is how I want to talk to you—to anyone—in written form.\nA Thought #The most critical decision of all is what you do at this moment.\nYou have multiple projects and multiple actions under those projects. The consolidation of these projects and actions could lead you towards your purpose.\nHowever, there is only this moment. The most critical decision of all is what you do at this moment—this action.\nBecause there is only a single list of actions, whatever you choose to do at this moment is your priority. The act of choosing one thing tells the world that this is what\u0026rsquo;s important for you at this time.\nOnce a choice has been made, the next critical step is to make peace with your choice and let go of what you didn’t choose to do. This is only possible if you make sure that what you choose to do is indeed what you need to do.\nA Quote # Celebrity, even the modest sort that comes to writers, is an unhelpful exercise in self-consciousness. Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face. As soon as one is aware of being ‘somebody,’ to be watched and listened to with extra interest, input ceases, and the performer goes blind and deaf in his over animation.\n— John Updike\nA Question #What can you do to lessen the noise, so you can hear yourself more?\n***\nThank you for reading.

Dorms are emptied by the pandemic, with no assurances of being occupied anytime soon. Then there are also those houses unoccupied for so long even before the pandemic started that termites and the elements, so domineering in forested areas like the campus, have already started to consume. I walked past one during one of my recent walks on the campus. It is one of the widest houses—American-style houses—built for qualified UP employees to live in. I had to stop to admire its size. How can something so large be so dilapidated? The posts that elevate the house are okay. But an entire wall of the house has been opened, and the stairs towards the door are missing several steps. No one can enter the door. Who lived here before? Why was it never inhabited again? Who opened the door last?

However, these questions are so important to let others do the asking. The answers for these questions determine all the other decisions we do in our life. We need to empower ourselves to ask these questions.\nTo do that, we need to make the process easier (i.e., less intimidating) and make it practical and relevant to us.\nOne way to make this process easier is by using art to experience, express, and interpret the questions.\nA Quote # The contemplation of things as they are, without substitution or imposture, without error or confusion, is in itself a nobler thing than a whole harvest of invention.\n— Francis Bacon\nA Question #What question did you contemplate recently?\n***\nThank you for reading.

A religious building and street art can coexist in one composition because the social context from where the image was taken allows it. Imagine a supra-religio-authoritarian world where everything “blasphemous” is removed, burned, destroyed, bulldozed, and everything the eye can see are just churches and religious relics. In that world, I could have never taken this photo. Conversely, imagine if the world was taken over by punks and every concrete known by man was painted with graffiti. In that world, it would be criminal to build churches, to practice religion, to be devoted to a belief. This photo would have never existed there. I wake up every day feeling grateful for the fact that I live in a pluralistic world, filled with people of different backgrounds and belief systems, counterbalancing each other when one group forces their opinions on another, preventing the rise of a single world order or a single global religion. I was able to compose the image above because I could.

One can be in a space where one feels safe and secure but is unable to voice out a contrarian opinion. This is faux security. A true safe space is a brave space, where one is allowed and encouraged to express disagreement if necessary.\nA Quote # Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing someone to change their tribe.

There is something about walking by yourself that makes you notice facets of the environment that you never knew was there before. And those facets break the monotony of walks. They are what you want to see. They’re like a vacation from the walk—a new discovery, dopamine triggers, eye candies, feet candies, worthy of being written down on your diary. And when they do come, sometimes they bring with them something extra on top.\nWhen I was walking down these stairs, looking for this angle, this shot, a woman, possibly in her 40s, definitely way older than me, was walking up, talking on her phone and holding a stick—not a walking stick, but a batuta. I waited for her to walk past me before opening up my camera. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like another subject crowding this already crowded photo. But after taking this shot, or was it the shot before it, I heard her voice, “Kuya, kuya, sandali lang. May sasabihin ako.”\nI looked up and she was walking back, down the stairs towards me. I saw her batuta again, and all kinds of thoughts came rushing into my head—“Is she a tanod? Or part of the police force that keeps on pestering my walks? Why is she a woman? I have never seen woman police inside UP before. Did I do anything wrong? I have my mask on. Perhaps the shield?”\nShe stopped on a stair, socially distant from me, and began uttering the most surprising words I heard that entire afternoon, perhaps even the entire day, or the entire week:\n“Kasi kuya nagpipicture ka diba?

I don’t want that to happen again, so I started my wait out of the campus when it started raining and the drops are not yet that big. Rains here in Los Baños are starting to come with strong winds, making any sort of walk difficult. I had to stop to take a photo of those orange lights though. I notice that whoever opens these lights opens them fairly early. What a waste of energy, I thought.

But before that, I want to, first, express once more my sincere gratitude to you for taking the time to read this weekly missive. I know that in this day of information overload, spending five minutes or more reading an email from some random unknown guy on the Internet could be a big sacrifice. I am aware of this and I appreciate the attention you are giving my work so much.\nThis is the 12th issue of Lilim—my last attempt to write a regular newsletter. Three months ago, before we started on this journey together, I expressed my hesitation to start it because of my past failed attempts to maintain a regular publishing schedule. I declared to the world (um, actually just a handful of you who are reading this) that if I fail to keep writing this newsletter every week, I will never start one again. Now, because of calendar reminders (thanks Google Calendar!) and repeating task reminders (thanks Things 3!), I am kept accountable to show up every week and write something for you.\nIt has been a lot of fun writing stories and essays regularly and complementing these with photographs I take in my daily walks. I have never felt fully expressed in my entire writing life as I am today. What\u0026rsquo;s more, taking the time to write and revise these essays multiple times a week has helped me hone my voice as a writer. I also came face-to-face with loopholes and unconscious grammar mistakes that I have been making probably for years! There is no better way to get better in writing but to write regularly even if it is just for oneself.\nThat said, my multipotentialite tendencies are still persistent, and there is so much more I want to do other than writing stories and essays about my walks with philosophical and artistic musings. Right now, I am being called to go back to translating Thoreau’s journal entries, a project I want to see through as a published book. I already have a sizable amount of translations, but there is so much more to do before a manuscript can even start to take shape.\nAside from this, I am once again being called to study the one question that my entire body of work revolves around— “How should I live?” More specifically, I am beginning to feel that I need to spend more time researching and writing about this question, so I can publish essays about it in this newsletter and in my blog.\nBecause of these recent changes in my artistic inclinations, I have decided to experiment with a new Lilim newsletter format starting next week. I will then call the first 12 issues of Lilim as Lilim Season 1.\nThe next 12 issues of Lilim will be its second season. In that series, I will still be releasing essays and stories when I have one to share, but I won’t be forcing myself to write one every week. Instead, most Lilim newsletter issues in its second season will contain:\na photograph from my photo archives, an insight from myself (gathered from my collection of notes I call Talahardin, a quote that has inspired me in the week, and a question for all of us to ponder about. With this new format, I expect that you will be able to go through the newsletter in just about three minutes or so. But I am hoping that whatever you find there could affect you much longer than that. A simpler format like this will cut the time I spend preparing the newsletter, and put that extra time into doing research, which I am hoping will improve the essays I will be writing in the future.\nOverall, what I am feeling right now is encapsulated in this quote by Emily Carr, a Canadian artist from the first half of the 1900s:\nYou will have to experiment and try things out for yourself and you will not be sure of what you are doing. That\u0026rsquo;s all right, you are feeling your way into the thing.\nAs I try to keep my promise of maintaining a weekly publishing routine, I am less sure of my direction but more open to possibilities. While I am a very, very intellectual person, I like to \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; myself during these situations—I follow what \u0026ldquo;feels\u0026rdquo; good and trust that that will make things okay, if not better. I don\u0026rsquo;t like to call this an intuitive process—because it is not. It is more like a dance between feelings and careful thought. And the music playing is \u0026ldquo;trust\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to dance with that tune. But I keep trying.\nAnyways, I\u0026rsquo;ll see you next week with Lilim Season 2. And once again—thank you, thank you, thank you so much for being here. I sincerely hope I can continue to serve you through my humble writing.\nLove,\nSome Random Unknown Guy from the Internet\n","date":"19 July 2021","permalink":"/lilim/012/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 012 — Ending the First Season"},{"content":"I took my mask from the hook where I hang it and started wrapping it around my chin. I will cover my mouth once I’m outside and the first person comes. This is something I say to myself to stop being annoyed with all this mask-wearing.\nI picked up my face shield and placed it inside my bag. I usually wear it on top of my head like a headband because—why the fuck are we still wearing these in the Philippines when the entire world isn’t already? This is where it stays most of the time unless I enter an establishment. But I am not entering any establishment today. In fact, I’ll just be walking around the neighborhood to see what else I can see.\nI realized I still haven’t walked on two nearby streets—Sierra Madre and Banawe. These are the two streets parallel to my street (Mt. Data). I pass by the two of them whenever I walk Onyx Street towards UP. Since I am feeling a little lazy today, I decided to just explore these two streets nearby.\nAs I got out the gate, I looked up at the sky and saw that the sun is still up. There are clouds everywhere. Soft light, I said. This is good.\nI encountered a quote that I have been pondering a lot recently. James Clear shared it in his newsletter. It is a quote from Thomas Mitchell, a well-educated farmer who wrote essays on how to live well in 1913, a few years before the First World War. The compilation of these essays was published in a book I am still about to read—Essays on Life by Thomas Mitchell, Farmer.\nThe quote says:\nOne of the best secrets of a happy life is the art of extracting comfort and sweetness from every circumstance\u0026hellip;\nPeople are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or power to seek and find.\nIf we are to cultivate the art of living, we should cultivate the art of extracting sweetness and comfort out of everything, as the bee goes from flower to flower in search of honey.\nI love this bee metaphor to visualize how the process of living a full life happens.\nIn a lot of ways, the world is a large field full of experiences (flowers), where we can extract comfort, joy, happiness, or Ginhawa (nectar). Thoreau looked at the world the same way. He likened the sights of the world to a harvest that must be reaped by those who walk in Nature. He wrote in his journal:\nWe pass haymakers in every meadow, who may think that we are idlers. But Nature takes care that every nook and crevice is explored by someone. While they look after the open meadows, we farm the tract between the river’s brinks and behold the shores from that side. We, too, are harvesting an annual crop with our eyes, and think you Nature is not glad to display her beauty to us?\nAugust 6, 1858\nThoreau was a bee and the beauty around him was his nectar. He would walk with a notebook in one hand and a pen in another, jotting down very brief notes about things he sees in his walks—a bird flying by, a small stream breaking the silence, a rainy summer afternoon. In the morning after his walks, he would expand these brief notes into long journal entries, written with so much beauty and care that they turned out to be his most important work.\nA honeybee sucks nectar through a long tongue called a proboscis. Thoreau’s proboscis—the thing he uses to extract sweetness and comfort out of everything—is his attention guided by his eyes, which are supported by an external tool, a pen, and a notebook, where the nectar gathered were recorded.\nI am currently going deep in photography, and I realized that in a lot of ways, photography makes for a very good proboscis. With mindfulness and a keen eye, a camera can be a powerful tool to capture the sweetness and comfort all around us. In one way, images can even be more powerful tools for this purpose compared to the words we write in a journal.\nA camera simply captures light, but the quality and form of that light are informed by many things—the amount of light itself, the subjects in one\u0026rsquo;s surroundings, emotions present in those subjects, movement, etc. And all of these don’t just inform what is captured and recorded. They are all present in that recorded artifact. Words can’t easily do this. They are not as direct as images.\nThrough images, the simplest of all flowers—or streets—can be a rich source of beauty. Sierra Madre and Banawe streets are not as visually exciting as the other streets I\u0026rsquo;ve walked in. But look at the nectars I have extracted from them.\nSky, trees, roof, meter More meters\u0026hellip; A gate that has seen years A Japanese-themed dormitory I like to walk—a lot. But I am too lazy—not to mention too incapable—to capture through words what I see in these walks. And so I take photos instead—try to take at least. Photography allows me to articulate the things I cannot express well through words. It allows me to just shut up—and just look. It trains my eyes to pay attention so that I don\u0026rsquo;t ask for more than what is already in front of me. Instead, I grab what is already here with my bare hands and extract every single drop of sweetness and comfort from it.\n","date":"12 July 2021","permalink":"/lilim/011/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 011 — Extracting Sweetness and Comfort Out of Everything"},{"content":"I find it amazing how encountering a certain work of art could change how I see the world almost instantly. This is what I love about reading books, watching films, visiting galleries, and listening to music. When the art and the person behind it are the right ones, this internal world reorganization happens easily.\nSince practicing meditation and visiting Nature almost every day, I realized that if I cultivate a daily mindful state, I would feel more at home. I am naturally melancholic. This tendency has always been within me. However, I discovered that through mindfulness, I am able to transform this melancholia into an existential feeling where every single thing I see around me, and every single moment, bursts into a supernova of awe and deep appreciation.\nThere’s one caveat though—I need a trigger for this to happen. And that trigger is usually a unique and excellent work of art.\nThis happened to me recently.\nI maintain a digital reading inbox using Instapaper. A reading inbox is simply a place where we can save reading materials (usually articles) for future consumption. I subscribe to several newsletters like the one you are reading right now, and I review these at least once a week. Some of the newsletters I am subscribed to, like Austin Kleon’s, contain links to different articles or resources taken from around the Internet. I open these links, take a quick glance through the resource, and if it piqued my interest or if it is related to a project that I am currently doing, I save it on Instapaper.\nI usually visit my Instapaper to read when I am on a commute or waiting for someone. Last April, while visiting my girlfriend’s family and waiting for lunch to be served, I decided to open this article from Wired that I saved many months ago. It was entitled The Glorious, Almost-Disconnected Boredom of My Walk in Japan. Mind you, many of these articles that I save never make it to reading proper. When they have been left untouched for more than two weeks, I usually delete them as that\u0026rsquo;s an indication that they\u0026rsquo;re not that relevant to my current projects. For some reason, I kept this article. I do not know why. It just felt like something I wanted to read later. And I finally read it at that opportunity. And my, was my world changed!\nAfter reading the article, I enjoyed it so much—the words and the photographs alike—that I decided to dig deeper into the author and his work. The writer’s name was Craig Mod, and he has been living in Japan for several decades, the last of which he devoted to walking Japan’s beautiful historical and cultural pilgrimage routes.\nOn his site, I saw more of his photography and writing. I immersed myself in his love of Japanese culture. Through his work, I felt like Japan, both its breathtaking landscapes and ordinary everyday objects, is an existential paradise, a place where I am reminded of the miracle that is living every single moment.\nSuddenly, I was reconnected to a similar feeling, a similar state of mind, I had in the past—during a trip to Coron, Palawan. While riding a boat home after a day of island hopping, I looked far over the horizon. The sun has not yet fully descended, but clouds were covering it, leaving a dim warm yellow light that illuminated the waters. I saw the vastness of it all, the little waves over a quiet ocean making tiny silent movements, with only the boat’s motor to be heard in the background. At that moment, I felt the oneness and interconnectedness of everything. And that was the time I was still reading Jeff Foster and exploring Advaita Vedanta. I no longer read him nor agree with his philosophy, but my inner world was similarly reorganized at that time, much like I recently experienced with Craig Mod.\nWhat happens after this reorganization is that I usually go about my day, chugging along with my usual activities, but noticing every little nuance—a tiny maya perched on a branch of a tree, a simple window that created a beautiful frame of a scene outside, a leaf twirling around as it hanged on a thread of spider web, and a broken street light that blinks. All of these, I notice, and I can’t stop it. It is as if my senses are heightened and I pay attention easily to almost everything but noise and distraction. I am ever-present, ever mindful.\nWhenever this happens, I am more motivated to take photos and write. I become more existential and, therefore, philosophical. I think better and insights come easier. This combination of deep experience of the world and careful meditative thinking creates a rich experience that I try my best to keep as possible.\nAnd this is exactly what Thoreau did and represented. Like Craig Mod, Thoreau has deeply affected how I see the world and my work. Thoreau was so effective in balancing experience and thought. In the morning he wrote—eventually exclusively about the things he saw in his walks. And I would assume that this was also the time he delved into philosophy and the field of ideas. This was the time he dedicated to getting familiar with his own thoughts—“the children of his mind” as he called them. He cultivated his intellectual and mental process in the morning and cultivated mindfulness, attention, and awe—by taking very long walks and taking notes—in the afternoon until evening.\nCraig Mod, with his body of work, has done something similar. He is somehow a modern-day Thoreau. He doesn’t have that many books as Thoreau had nor is he very interested in philosophy as Thoreau was, but like Thoreau, he walks, takes pictures, takes notes, talks to people along the way, and cultivates presence, savoring, and mindfulness—things that even science says will make us happy.\nKnowing how great art—no, let’s rephrase that, honest, authentic, joyful art—could completely change how people experience their lives and the world should be enough motivation for any artist to keep going in a path where the destination is not always easy to see.\n","date":"5 July 2021","permalink":"/lilim/010/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 010 — Good Art Reorganizes Your World"},{"content":"Writing by itself is simply communication.\nWhen I pick up pen and paper, I have ideas inside I want to bring out. In this process, I do two things:\n1. I express myself.\n2. I talk to someone.\nAlthough I do both of these things at the same time when I write, it is important to see their distinction especially when I want to be very intentional about how I communicate. When I am in express mode, I don’t try to edit myself. I just try to be as honest as possible. But when I shift to talk mode, that’s when I start to question how I first expressed my ideas. I become an editor trying to put myself in the shoes of the person I am trying to connect to. I want to make myself as clear as possible. But no matter what mode I am in, I am sure that I want one thing when I write: I want to be heard.\nAt the core of being a writer is wanting to be heard. That’s it. Writing is not about being published or getting an award. Those are nice to have. But they are not the point of writing. Writing is simply self-expression and communication, and in the middle of both of them is a psychological desire to be heard.\nAnd so every writer needs to ask themselves how much they want that need to be fulfilled. Yes, how much. This is a question of quantity.\nHow many people does a person need to be heard?\nFive? Ten? A hundred? A thousand? A million?\nWhat does it takes to feel seen, listened to, heard?\nThe reason why I believe this is important to ask oneself as a writer is that your answer to the question of quantity defines how much you are willing to sacrifice to finally feel heard. Because there is a difference—a huge difference— between expressing yourself to one person and expressing yourself to a thousand. In the latter, you stay in talk mode a bit longer, you tend to censor things you wanted to say but ought not to just because the stakes are higher.\nThe funny thing about this question of quantity is that if we really think of it, most of the time, we only need one person listening to us really well in order to feel that we are heard. And even a funnier thought is that that person can be oneself. We are made up of at least two people inside us, and we talk to him or her everytime. How we communicate with this person within us is far more important than how we communicate with the rest of the world. I strongly think that the best writers ever to walk this planet are writers who were able to listen and talk to that person within them most effectively.\nSo why do we need other people to feel heard? This is a question I am still pondering about. It is a question that also prompts me to doubt the very purpose of a platform such as this newsletter. Do I really need to send a missive to a handful of people every week to feel seen and heard?\nI don’t know. You tell me.\nPerhaps I will feel heard if you reply to this email and tell me your thoughts.\n","date":"28 June 2021","permalink":"/lilim/009/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 009 — You Want to Be Heard"},{"content":"One of the creepiest things I realized during my first ever meditation experience around 2015 to 2016 was being aware, for the first time, of the involuntary influx of thoughts in my mind.\nWith nothing to do but sit still with closed eyes, counting my breath one after the other, it became almost instantly obvious that focusing on this task was impossible.\nI think this realization was what hooked me to meditation. I have been counting my breath for about six years since, doing so almost every day, in the morning and the evening.\nIt is this same realization that draws other people to meditation. It is what wakes most of us from the slumber of mindlessness. It is the first blow to the illusion that we are in full control of our thoughts and our life in general.\nA single minute of meditation is enough to make us see through this illusion. Meditating shows us the fact that the majority of our thoughts are automatic. They come from an indecipherable source and arrive when we least expect them. They even come when we don’t want them to come. Creatives notice this a lot and many of us find it so difficult to take ownership of our own ideas and thoughts.\nMeditation makes this clear: We do not control the influx of thoughts in our mind.\nBut does this mean that we are forever at the mercy of our minds? Or is there something within our mental space that gives us a sense of control?\nWhile I realized that I do not control the influx of thoughts in my mind, I notice that I can actually control whether to pay attention to some thoughts or not. This is possible because there seems to be another persona within my mental space that simply watches the involuntary influx of thoughts. This persona is able to distance and even detach himself from the thoughts.\nThis persona that watches does not necessarily produces thoughts. I am not yet sure of that. But I am sure that he is good at one thing: paying attention. I am tempted to say that this persona is the real me. I am not my thoughts, I am that which watches my thoughts.\nThis persona that watches is the seat of control and free will. I think what is most important to realize from all these is this:\nThe only real thing we can control is our attention.\nWhat happens outside our minds—even our physical bodies—is ultimately outside of our control. What we have ultimate control of is there within our minds. But we can’t control the influx of thoughts in our mind. That leaves us with the watcher—it is the only thing we can truly control. Attention is our truest domain of freedom.\nAttention is therefore our ultimate battleground. If it is the only true domain of free will, the more important question to ask is:\nAre we protecting our attention from everything that could rob us of it?\n","date":"20 June 2021","permalink":"/lilim/008/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 008 — The Only Thing We Can Truly Control"},{"content":"Makikita ng mga tao ‘to at sasabihin nilang Falls!\nPero hindi ito falls. Tubig lang ito na nahuhulog mula sa kalsada at dumadausdos sa malalaking bato sa ibaba. Mala-falls, pero hindi talaga falls.\nNatetempt tuloy akong tawagin siyang False.\nNakita ko ang anino ko sa umaagos na tubig habang tinatawid ko ang kalsada. Tumigil ako upang piktyuran siya.\nMukhang artipisyal ang falls na ‘to, pero ang tubig nito ay tubig ng Bumbungan River. Hindi ko alam saan eksakto nanggagaling ang tubig sa ilog na’to, pero sa mapa, dinaraanan nito ang ilang barangay ng Cavinti. May twin falls pa nga na Bumbungan rin ang pangalan! Ang mga ito talaga ang tunay na mga falls. Pero hindi ata sila masyadong kilala dahil wala sila sa Google maps.\nSigurado akong galing sa bulubundukin ng probinsya ng Quezon ang tubig ng Bumbungan River. Napakalayo ng tinawid ng tubig na ito para lamang umagos sa kinatatayuan ko at hugasan ang mga libag ko sa paa. Tapos, magniniig sila ng mga tubig ng Cavinti River at sabay bubulusok sa mga talon ng Pagsanjan at Naculo kung saan sila pagpipiyestahan ng mga tao.\nAy, \u0026lsquo;wag naman sana nilang malunok ang pinaghugasan ko.\nPagkatapos kong maghugas, iniwan ko na ang False at sinundan ang kalmadong agos ng tubig na nagsususuot sa gahiganteng mga bato sa gilid at gitna ng ilog.\nHinulog ba ng mga trak ang mga batong ito? O nandito na sila noon pa? Mukhang taga dito talaga sila pero sinimento sila sa gilid ng bangin para maiwasan ang pagguho ng lupa kapag malakas ang ulan.\nHabang mas lumalayo ako sa False, mas nagiging tahimik ang ilog. Kamangha-mangha kung paanong ang isang bagay na sobrang ingay at garalgal ay kagyat na nagiging tahimik at kalmado. Pero \u0026lsquo;yan ang tubig—mabilis dumaloy, mabilis mag-iba.\nNagpatuloy ako sa paglakad sa tabi ng tahimik na tubig, sa ilalim ng tulay. Pakiramdam ko\u0026rsquo;y tinitignan ako ng mga taong lulan ng kani-kanilang sasakyan mula sa itaas. Para akong hayop na nakatira sa natural kong tirahan at pinagmamasdan ng mga turista. Nagtago ako sa anino ng tulay nang hindi ako makita.\nTumango ako at nakita ang usok na nanggagaling mula sa kung saan. Hindi naman ito amoy inihaw. Siguro’y may nagsisiga lang. Pero bakit hindi ko rin naaamoy ang siga? Dinadalisay ba ng halipawpay ng ilog ang usok?\nNagsasalamin ang araw sa tubig. Kumikislap ang ilaw tulad ng patay-sinding bombilya.\nHabang nagpatuloy ako sa paglalakad, nagsimulang kumipot ang ilog at mas dumami ang mga bato. Dito nagliliparan ang maiitim na tutubi na may bughaw at berdeng batik. Kakaiba ang kanilang itsura. Para silang mga paru-paro. Mabagal pumagaspas ang kanilang mga pakpak. Parang mas mabigat ang mga ito kaysa kanilang katawan. Mga gamu-gamo silang mahahaba ang mga buntot.\nMayroon ding mga pulang tutubi—mga karayom ng diyablo! Kumikinang ang kanilang pagka-pula sa ilalim ng araw.

Saan Siya Patungo?"},{"content":"I thought the road will never end.\nOn the left was a large piece of land, mostly uncultivated, unfenced, filled with talahib, and encircled by large trees, probably mahogany. Trees lined up that side of the road, creating a natural border that prevents trespassers from entering.\nWhoever owns the land may have lost interest in it. Perhaps because it was too far from town or because they had no enough resources to develop such a large estate. Whatever their reason, birds, reptiles, insects, and weeds are happy about it. They rejoice for the success of their very own crusade to reclaim what was their ancestors’ land. The more disinterested people are about their lands the better it is for them.\nOn the right side of the road were several houses, many of them clustered together and separated from other houses by smaller pieces of uncultivated land. The grass on this side is short and goats graze on whatever is left in them. There were also very few trees and even little human activity.\nThis place is silent, I told myself—a perfect place to build a farm.\nI was already the only passenger in the tricycle when we entered this never-ending road. I paid extra for the driver to bring me directly to HEAL, the permaculture farm I was visiting. We left town full—three inside the main carriage then two outside, along with the driver, who had to move a seat forward towards the motor’s gasoline tank to accommodate both of us behind him.\nI always pity tricycle drivers whenever they do that. To earn more, they had to put another body behind them. This forces them to sit in a very uncomfortable position—their groin over the gasoline tank and closer to the steering rod, their legs folded as if already kneeling, and their heads bowed down while, of course, looking in front of them. But I am not sure what I am more afraid of—the driver’s legs breaking or the tricycle tumbling altogether.\nAs I neared my destination, the tricycle started emptying up—one passenger after another. When the main carriage was empty, I had the option to go in. However, I chose to stay behind the driver, where I had a closer view of what was happening outside.\nThe illusion of the never-ending road was an illusion after all. After just around three minutes, I saw the end of the road—an open gate with large letters painted all over it:\nHEAL\nHAVEN FOR ECOLOGICAL AND ALTERNATIVE LIVING\nMEDICAL MISSION SISTERS\nI got off the tricycle, gave P40 to the driver, thanked him, and started my way in.\nI started walking towards the first visible structure—a small two-story house covered in green.\nAs I made my way towards the house, I felt a sense of relief. The travel was too long for a place that seems just near. To get here from our house in San Jacinto, I had to ride the bus from Dagupan bound to Cubao, which passes in front of our house and stops at Manaoag, the popular pilgrimage town. There, it waits for 30 minutes to get filled up. To catch it, I could either wait for it in front of our house or ride a jeep to Manaoag, hoping that the bus is still there. I usually do the latter as, most of the time, the bus is indeed still there, cutting my waiting time. If I wait for it back home, I will still wait for another 30 minutes once we get to Manaoag.\nWhile on the bus, we passed over several towns in Eastern Pangasinan—Laoac, Binalonan, and Urdaneta. These are the new towns, differentiated from the old towns by the sheer number of Ilocano-speaking people that inhabit them. In the early 1800s, Ilocanos began their diaspora from Ilocos to nearby provinces, populating thousands of acres of open arable land. Since most Pangasinan-speaking folks lived near the coastal areas of the province, the inner forests and grasslands were left open to migrants to cut, cultivate, and develop. These areas became the Ilocano-speaking towns of Pangasinan.\nAfter Urdaneta, our bus arrived at Villasis, the second to the last Ilocano-speaking town of Pangasinan that the bus passes by before entering Tarlac. The bus dropped us at the famous vegetable market or bagsakan and behind it, I started looking for a tricycle bound to Capulaan. I found one and waited for it to get filled.\nAfter waiting, it was still a long ride from town to HEAL. The view along the way is mostly fields—sometimes rice, sometimes onions, other times just a small patch of a vegetable garden. I remember seeing wide wooden trellises filled with ampalaya in one of the wide fields we passed along the way.\nI wouldn’t say that the travel from San Jacinto to here was arduous, only that it was longer than usual. And so I felt relieved to finally arrive, especially after seeing how well-shaded the farm was. There were large trees everywhere—very large trees.\nBefore coming here, I communicated with Sr. Lynn, one of the five senior nuns living on the farm. I got her number from their website. She was supposed to meet me, so I texted her when I arrived. She replied and asked me to wait.\nI arrived at the two-story house surrounded by plants. It had a cemented first floor and a wooden second floor. An old woman was sitting on a tiny chair outside the door. I greeted her and she greeted me back. I would later know that this was Sr. Naty, the oldest nun living at HEAL.\nI chatted with Sr. Naty for a while until Sr. Lynn finally showed up and welcomed me. She asked me to follow her to a large open building in the middle of tall trees. Like the previous building, this structure had a foundation built using concrete but with kawayan and wood on its walls and second floor.\n“We tried building with pure wood alone, but termites are so ferocious here in Pangasinan. We decided to use cement even for just our foundations,” Sr. Lynn explained.\nThe first floor was mostly open. There were almost no walls covering it, only those that covered rooms. The second floor was of course walled for safety purposes. It had several beds lined up one after another, covered and divided only by large boards of rattan, which made it look like a dorm of some sort. This is where the nuns accommodate guests or retreat participants, which frequent HEAL every year.\n“If you opt to start volunteering here, you will be staying here for the night, Vince. I hope you don’t mind that the space here is mostly open. And please don’t be afraid of rats. When you see them walking around, they’re probably hunting for snakes,” Sr. Lynn shared. She continued saying that they don’t kill snakes here. When a snake is lost inside any of the farm\u0026rsquo;s buildings, they pick it up using a stick and put it back to the rice fields so it could find its way back home. In Sta. Maria, we killed all snakes we see.\nI was not sure what bothered me more, the mention of rats or the mention of snakes. But whatever. I was here to learn about a different way to live and not even rats or snakes could derail me from that.\nAfter showing me the accommodation building, Sr. Lynn guided me to the immediate surroundings outside. She showed me a short tree with clusters of round, green plump fruits surrounding its trunk. They covered the trunk so much that they looked like parasites—children pulling down an old woman to the ground. The fruits were too many they were falling around the poor tree. The tree was really short, just about five meters, and I felt like these bunches of fruits were making her even shorter.\n“Where this tree grows, there is water. Thus, it is called tibig,” Sr. Lynn said.\nThe tree is one of several indigenous trees that the nuns planted around HEAL. As I spent more time on the farm, I learned more about our indigenous trees and their relationship with plants introduced from outside the Philippines. But the tibig tree was special because it made me realize how little I knew about the trees that flourished in this country long before I was even born.\nBeside the tibig tree was a large box that looked like a treasure chest with a green cover. It stood with four long legs. Sr. Lynn laid her hand on the box and started explaining that this box used to house honeybees during a time when the farm attempted to keep them.\nSr. Lynn also showed their plant nursery and the mandala-shaped vegetable beds in the middle of the farm.\nBut what really fascinated me was their vermicompost facility. Housed under a structure made of bamboo and nipa were three concrete containers filled with what looked at first like soil and rotting vegetables and leaves. Sr. Lynn introduced me to Julius, one of the three or four gardeners working full-time at HEAL. He was about my age but is already a father of one. He was in charge of the vermicompost and he explained to me the basics of what was happening in front of me.\nThe rightmost container held the raw materials for composting—mostly made up of vegetable scraps but also chopped banana trunks and other materials that are intentionally introduced by Julius. These served as food for the vermiculture worms that live underneath the container. They eat the scraps and excrete them into a very potent fertilizer—the vermicast. When vermicast accumulates, Julius shovels and transfers them into the two containers on the left, where they are later harvested for farm use. Sometimes, they are also sold for extra income. I’ve never heard of vermiculture before and so this really fascinated me.\nAfter leaving Julius, Sr. Lynn showed me their vegetable trellises and greenhouses.\nThen she showed me this fascinating shrub that had pointed leaves, red stems, and pink flowers.\n“This is the roselle. I learned from the local people that they use the flower to cook sinigang. But we also use it to make jam,” Sr. Lynn shared.\nThis comment was interesting to me because Pangasinan-speaking folk do not use this flower in cooking sinigang. This practice seems to be an Ilocano practice and so was hidden from my knowledge for a very long time until now.\nAs Sr. Lynn continued her tour of the farm, I can’t help but notice this large structure that loomed above trees all over HEAL. It looked like a windmill with a large container underneath it. When I asked Sr. Lynn about the structure, she said that it harbors wind energy to extract water from the ground, which then fills up the container. This structure helps HEAL become more self-sufficient in its water supply.\nFittingly, Sr. Lynn ended our tour at the farm’s chapel—a relatively small circular structure, which like most buildings in HEAL, had a concrete foundation but wooden frames all throughout. And like the other structures, it was open-aired.\nThere was an altar in front of chairs arranged in a semi-circle. A gong was nearby, perhaps used as a time-keeping instrument throughout religious services. There was a guitar on the side, as well as a podium and a table with images and icons.\nBut the most striking of all the objects in the chapel was the cross—two rugged wooden planks attached together, beautifully adorned with garments and paint, with a three-fingered branch of a tree nailed on them. This branch was Jesus—faceless like the earth.\nIt had a raw, laid-back look that camouflaged with its surrounding, almost concealed by the colors of the trees, the branches, the wood that filled all of HEAL.\nI am not a Catholic and have long left the Christian path. But there is something about the humility of this cross that resonated with me deeply.\nI left HEAL in the afternoon, promising to go back soon to start volunteering. I planned on trying out just two days, sleeping over for a night, to test if doing work on the farm will suit me.\nI walked the same narrow road that led me to this quiet abode in Villasis.\nI looked at the same trees, the same rocks, the same sky.\nBut, oh, how different they were!\n","date":"7 June 2021","permalink":"/lilim/006/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 006 — A Walk Around HEAL"},{"content":"“We as a couple. We choose to be anonymous.”\nShe said as she looked me straight in the eye, her stare piercing as if to stress that this is something very important to her.\n“But I will share the video on social media so that others could benefit from it,” she ended.\nThis is my dull attempt to remember the exact words said on that Tuesday afternoon, while a torrential rain poured outside, water falling from the tall trees that covered the wide single-floor house we were all cozied in.\nI was sitting beside two friends with whom I woke up early to see what flowering trees are left around the campus. I thought we would be done in a couple of hours that I even elected to not feed my cats until I got back home. But after having omelet brunch together with the new friends they introduced me to, we were still there outside, 3 pm, while my cats purred in hunger back at home.\nI think we were drinking chocolate while this conversation happened. And mind you, this was just after we ate chocolate. All that chocolate in my system helped me pay attention—I heard everything my new friend said amidst the loud downpour of rain over the steel roof.\nFreebirth #The video she was referring to was a video of her giving birth to her son by herself, with her husband only watching and documenting the entire process. She was a believer of autonomous birthing—a philosophy of giving birth where the pregnant woman directs how everything happens. This self-direction extends to things that should happen before and after the birthing.\nShe did not go through any conventional program that most soon-to-be mothers go through before giving birth. She did not go through a nutritional program under a physician nor fasted before giving birth—a protocol that doctors give so that, in the event a woman needs to undergo a cesarian section, it would be easier for them to perform it.\nShe did not push for her son to come out. She waited, letting her body and son communicate to do the process naturally. And when her son came out, after about 11 hours of labor, no one cut the umbilical cord. She and her husband waited for about 30 minutes—enough time for the blood from the placenta to transfer from mother to child through the umbilical cord. After 30 minutes, she had another contraction, this was her second birth—the birth of the placenta, the wonder organ of pregnancy, which most of us take for granted. She and her husband, gently tugged the umbilical cord until the placenta slipped out of her, physically separating mother and child for the first time.\nHer son will stay connected with the umbilical cord and the placenta for five more days until the cord naturally separated from the child. This process was beautifully called \u0026ldquo;lotus birth\u0026rdquo;—birthing the child intact with the cord and the placenta.\nI am writing this, still in awe of the story. And if you are curious, yes, I watched the video of her giving birth—a shortened 11-minute video cut from the entire footage (Update: My friend and her husband have generously released an even shorter version of the freebirth video online. You can now watch it below).\nBirthing and Autonomy #It was my first time to watch someone give birth and it is one of the most eye-opening things I’ve ever seen. My life is completely different after seeing the footage. I felt a strong feeling of gratitude to my mother and my sister, both mothers of three children, as I was watching the video.\nBut when I went home that night, and in the following days, what the entire experience left me was an affirmation of one of my deepest values—a value so intricately weaved in everything that I do and want to see in the world. A value that even Nature teaches us.\nThat value is autonomy.\nLike my friend and her husband, I am a believer of autonomy. I believe in autonomy because it is impossible for me to feel good and to live well without feeling free. What makes me feel good is a very personal and subjective thing. What makes me feel good is not necessarily what makes you feel good—or what makes the majority of people feel good for that matter.\nFor example, walking alone or with friends in Nature is fun for me. But I bet not everyone could stand the silence and stillness of the mind required in such an activity. Most people would rather listen to music or go to a party to have “fun.”\nNow, here is where autonomy enters. Imagine if someone or the state, for example, imposes a law where everyone is required to have fun ONLY by walking alone in Nature!\nSuch a rule is unfair. Walking alone in Nature is not fun for many people. It is not what makes them feel good. And yet all of us need to follow such a rule because of fear. We fear punishment and so we give our freedom away. We are stripped off of our autonomy and made to submit to such a preposterous rule!\nNow extend this scenario in everything that we hold dear in life—education, health, childbirth, work. What you get is a very unhappy world of people with no sense of free will, where everyone does the same, and everyone has forgotten what makes them feel good.\nAutonomy is Essential to Self-actualization #In order for us to feel true happiness, we need to be able to govern our lives, to have the ability to dictate what we want to do, when, and how. The more autonomy we have, the more power we have in curating our context. The more power we have in curating our context, the bigger our possibility of experiencing positive emotions. Optimal happiness can only be achieved in a world where individual freedom is optimized first.\nAnd if that isn’t enough to convince you how good freedom is for you, then it might help for you to know that according to studies, people who feel free are more motivated and have longer lives.\nFor sure, freedom is not easy, because freedom requires self-reliance, and oh boy, do we fear relying on ourselves!\nBut between dependence on authority and freedom to create our own lives, the latter is closer to what we know deep within us is good for us. And what better way of building a world of autonomy than letting mothers bring their children to the world in full freedom.\n","date":"30 May 2021","permalink":"/lilim/005/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 005 — Autonomy Makes a Long Life"},{"content":"I have always wondered why even the most enduring religious, spiritual, philosophical, or psychological traditions can not put an end to violence, why these cannot inspire everyone to show kindness and compassion once and for all.\nI think what is imminent from this is that human personality is too complex for a single tradition to claim to be able to influence. A one-size-fits-all approach to transforming people from being selfish and violent to selfless and compassionate is always doomed to fail.\nThe things that many of us (even atheists) aspire to—compassion, kindness, love—are things that are not “given”. They are nurtured. Yes, we were born with the capacity to show them (as we are to not show them), but they don’t flourish by themselves. To grow, they need to be revisited and reenacted. In other words, they have to be practiced.\nNow, that nurturing starts from childhood. The science shows that our genetic make up makes us predisposed to certain emotions. I, for example, think that I am genetically prediposed to sadness and anger because, based on self-knowledge and how I scored in the Big Five Personality Test, I am moderately high in neuroticism. On the other hand, those of us who are more extroverted have a better chance of experiencing more positive emotions.\nMost of our parents will never know this. Most of them won’t be able to build a custom-made program to raise us in a way that targets our genetic flaws. The tools and styles they used to raise us are all based on what they knew, which were from their parents too. They think that raising a child is a no-brainer, that it only takes common sense to do it—work hard, earn money, and provide material needs to your children and you’re good. But obviously, that is a very deficient view of parenthood.\nAn ideal parent is like a true professional, who should update their knowledge about best practices in their profession and then apply those. But most parents don’t see parenthood as a profession and our society look down on stay-at-home parents. Most of us, especially the parents themselves, don’t see that what they are doing is perhaps the most important job in the world.\nChildhood is not our only shot in constructing a better, more compassionate world, but is is a very critical shot—it is the foundation of all our efforts. Of course, even a perfectly raised child could enter the world and see how ugly it is. It could shake them up and make them unlearn everything they knew growing up. But at least, they have something to look back to—a reference and reminder of what is possible.\nChildren who were raised in a kind, compassionate household have a first-hand experience of what a kind, compassionate environment is. They know that it is possible because they lived in it. Not all of them can be saved when they start entering society. But some of them will.\nWe only have two battlegrounds: home and society. The majority of us will never be able to influence society. Even democratic processes that suppose to give us power are easily manipulated by the already powerful. And anything that an ordinary citizen can do to influence society can easily be eclipsed by larger, richer, and more influential entities.\nBut when one takes the role of a parent—an adult that guides young human beings—they don’t realize this often but they just received a very critical privilege of constructing a mini-society inside their own home, a place where government and civic society has less power over.\nA home is a little society, which parents can either turn into a democracy or even an anarchic society where children are allowed to follow their own passions, as what happens in unschooling families.\nNow here is where Nature becomes a powerful tool for parents to tap. Nature helps little human beings be more compassionate. Personally, when I am in nature, I am able to calm down, generate more positive emotions, and process negative emotions better. When I\u0026rsquo;m down, feeling antsy, or annoyed, I just walk. That\u0026rsquo;s the reason why I cannot live in a place with no trees and nature-filled spaces.\nAnd what I find when I walk is that it is just so difficult to hate someone else when you are faced by a beautiful sunset or a star-filled sky enveloping you from above.\nParents can incorporate regular nature visits to parenting. A complete retreat from modern society and communion with nature is one of the best tools we have in raising children who would be more resilient when faced by the violent and less compassionate society.\nParents should never take parenting lightly—nor nature for that matter. We should make the most out of these two tools. It might be our only chance for building a more beautiful world our hearts know is possible.\nUntil next week,\nVince\n***\nP.S. I am not a parent, but I’m an unschooling proponent and this connection between childhood and nature fascinates me. If you are a parent, I would love to know your thoughts about the ideas I mentioned here.

They look entirely the same; only their colors were different. One was yellow; the other was fuchsia. They grew underneath the walls of a large school run by the religious, so I am not sure whether they were cultivated or whether they were wild.\nI later learned that they were Umbrellaworts or four-o’clocks, named after the time of the day when their flowers open. I usually walk around 4 or 5 in the afternoon, so perhaps it made sense that I saw these bright flowers at that time.\nSince I didn’t know their identity at that moment, what struck me was the duality of their colors, their being together, their being the same yet different. It reminded of a new friend I recently found from the vast world of the Internet. This friend filled a void that I didn’t have for quite some time—a void that made me feel less complete in my search for truth.\nWe all need partners—conversation partners—but more so if we are interested in the truth. While I still think that the search for an accurate description of reality should always start and end within oneself, I also find that we need others to make this search sustainable. Otherwise, it can be a long lonely monologue.\nBut a truth partner performs an even more important role. My new friend shared me this quote from Marcus Aurelius a few weeks ago:\n“If anyone can refute me, show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective, I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone.”\nI love this so much! To achieve any success in a journey to truth, one needs to embrace this kind of humility—a humility, which in turn, encourages one to embrace openness.\nBut it can also feel the other way around. Maybe I know something that my truth partner would need to know. I should be ready to perform the role of an accountable honest friend who is brave enough to say when he disagrees and offer a better perspective.\nObviously, we are so infallible as human beings, and our efforts to share our perspective could easily lead to self-righteous criticism if we aren’t careful. That said, it is this very infallibility of our minds that necessitates dialogue. The quest for truth will only get better through talking to someone.\nAnd even if we come to philosophy not to understand the world or to take advantage of what Socrates called the “medicine for the soul” which philosophy provides, what better medicine can we get than a friendly conversation with an honest and kind truth seeker, perhaps late in a summer afternoon while walking and being amazed with umbrellaworts.\n","date":"27 May 2021","permalink":"/lilim/004/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 004 — Umbrellaworts and Truth Partners"},{"content":"Hello, my friend,\nThis week, I decided to be more intentional about my walks, partly because of encountering Craig Mod but also because I realized how unwise it was not to take full advantage of the place I currently live in.\nI am currently living in Los Baños, Laguna, a town 63 kms away from Manila. It is one of the many places in the Philippines that are fortunate enough to be situated in the middle of a mountain and a large body of water. The house I am living at is literally at the foot of Mt. Makiling, while Laguna Lake is just about a 30 minutes walk away.\nBefore the latest community quarantine in this part of the country, I went out for walks almost every day inside the University of the Philippines (UP) campus.

Makiling—trees start to get taller, bird songs become weirder, roads begin to ascend, and the wind starts to get colder.\nI relocated here last January and I must admit that I have settled on the comfortable routine of walking on Mt. Makiling’s foot every day. It wasn’t until this week that I decided to look at the map of Los Baños and see where else I might be able to walk. I was astounded after seeing that Mt. Makiling and UP already took about half of the entire municipality of Los Baños. And as long as the quarantine continues, that half remains off-limits to people who want to walk.\nLooking at the map—looking at things as they really are—I realized that there are a plethora of other places I could be walking to. And that is what I did.\nMy first line of business was to find a way to see the shore of Laguna Lake. Looking at the map once more, I saw that there are several barangays where roads and the shore seem to converge: Masili, Tadlak, Baybayin, Malinta, Mayondon, and Bayog.\nLast Monday, after visiting my girlfriend at Calamba, I decided to get off earlier at Baybayin and see if I can finally get to Laguna Lake’s shore. Among all the barangays I mentioned above, it has a street that goes directly to the shore: Burgos Street. I followed the map and I finally got to see the shore.\nIt was the first time in more than a year that I saw a body of water as large as Laguna Lake. It doesn’t have the same waves you will see from seashores but the largeness of this body of water can create that illusion that one is looking at the sea.\nI returned to the lake last Friday but visiting it through a new shore, on a basketball court at the tip of Mayondon.\nSeeing Laguna Lake both gladdened and saddened me. I was glad—very glad—that I heard waves again, that I felt that strong wind once more, that I saw the sunset in its most majestic form. But I was also deeply saddened because I realized that I felt, for the first time in what seems like a very long time, the emotions that the pandemic has deprived me—emotions I didn’t even know I was looking for.\nIsolation may indeed be saving our lives, but that kind of life we are saving is not a full life. A full life needs the outdoors. And even if I was already frequently outdoors during the quarantines, I now see that those were not enough. Mountains, seas, roads, ridges—they’re all waiting for us.\nDuring the old normal, it was already too difficult for many of us to see the beauty that is always around us. The pandemic did not make that any easier.\nIt did not just isolate us from each other. It isolated us from the planet, from the simple things that could bring us great joy.\nThese are things I am only realizing now even as I write these words.\nBeauty is everywhere. It can convince one to continue living and by doing so saves lives. I know, because beauty has saved me more than once.\nIf beauty is so critical, so vital in convincing us to \u0026ldquo;stay a little bit longer\u0026rdquo; in this cruel world, then to see beauty is a skill worth developing.\nIt is my sincere wish that this newsletter contributes to your own search for beauty in any way.\nMore next week,\nVince\n***\nP.S. I would love to know what part of the world you are currently living in. Where is your current location and how are you developing your skill of looking for the beauty that is always around you?\n","date":"14 May 2021","permalink":"/lilim/002/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 002 — Beauty Is Always Around You"},{"content":"Receive a weekly essay readable in three to six minutes, which weaves a philosophical insight with reflections on the outdoors and everyday life.\nThe Story Behind Lilim #Over the extent of my entire young life, and especially during my lowest moments, I have tried and retried to answer a single question that has always baffled me—How should I live?\nI see this question wherever I look and go. I see it in every book I pick up to read, every movie I watch, every artwork I stare at. It has even followed me to places I never imagined it will go—rice fields, lakes, mountains, the voluminous sky, bird songs, the warmth of dog and cat fur.\nAnd as I get older, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to realize that the question eludes an answer. I\u0026rsquo;m starting to see that its very nature is that of a guide that tells you how to walk but never when to arrive.\nPursuing this question has inspired me to write hundreds of essays and journal entries and to draw landscapes and take photographs to document and remember what I have seen.\nThe question has taught me that to try to discern what it means to live as a human being involves not only thinking about life but, perhaps more importantly, experiencing it and finding answers in the real world—outdoors.\nThis newsletter is my last attempt to bring to you the insights, observations, and stories, paired with photographs, that I have gathered and continue to gather throughout the years.\nIt will try to weave a tapestry that blends ancient and modern philosophical wisdom with humble but awe-inspiring experiences from communing with nature and everyday life.\nWhy Lilim? #Lilim is a Tagalog word that, with weird serendipity, captures everything I look forward to in a walk or a bicycle ride outdoors.\nLilim means shade made by any structure that blocks light from above. Usually, it refers to a shade that a tree makes, blocking sunlight, particularly on a very hot summer day.\nIn a country like the Philippines, a lilim is a friend of nature lovers. For some, it is the only reason why a walk outdoors is even attractive. Aside from the infrequent dry and cold weather days in the Philippines, which makes a shade-less walk possible, most communion with nature would be done under extreme heat from the sun from as early as nine in the morning to as late as five in the afternoon. To go out and walk in nature with a portable lilim, an umbrella, is acceptable but weird. People who walk here are able to do it because of a lilim, which is sometimes the canopy of tall trees that cover a forested path. In less forested paths, such as those in the middle of fields I used to walk on in Pangasinan, a lilim is less available, but its sight is welcomed and anticipated.\nI envy Thoreau for going out as early as after lunch to go for a walk that would end sometimes until eight in the evening. I am less dedicated to walking I guess—partly because I need to contend with digital distractions than Thoreau didn\u0026rsquo;t and partly because I need to wait for more shade, for more lilim. Thoreau was simply living in a colder place in the world, where the heat from the sun is more tolerable for long, reflective walks.\nHere in the Philippines, by four or five in the afternoon, the sun is less hot as it has begun its descent. This is often the time I go out to walk or ride my bike to discover a new path, visit an old one, and just find something new to see. Interestingly, while researching more about the word lilim, I discovered that its Pangasinan equivalent, sirom, is a synonym of the Tagalog word dapithapon or sunset. Sirom is also a Hiligaynon and Waray word, which means the same thing. Therefore, lilim is not just the shade of trees that I have taken refuge on during many of my walks and bike rides. Lilim is also the time when I took those walks—a time when I would often be alone in the middle of fields as farmers go home after a long day of work.\nAt that time, clouds are also more mature, much bigger, creating welcomed shades that block the sun—a phenomenon called by the similarly sounding Tagalog word lilom. The best lilom would create beautiful sceneries in the sky: celestial halos, long sun rays, and the much-awaited mackerel sky.\nThoreau once observed how shades made by clouds interacted with his emotional state during a walk:\nBy the mood of my mind, I suddenly felt dissuaded from continuing my walk, but I observed at the same instant that the shadow of a cloud was passing over the spot on which I stood, though it was of small extent, which if it had no connection with my mood, at any rate suggested how transient and little to be regarded that mood was. I kept on, and in a moment the sun shone on my walk within and without.\nJournal, July 23, 1851\nHowever, even the best lilom will not replace a good shade from an old tree—the perfect lilim.\nA lilim is where I am allowed to slow down, shift my walk from the dirt road towards the inner paths of my soul. It is where rest is possible, where stillness happens. It is where one’s immediate natural surroundings and one’s intimate thoughts, feelings, and insights begin to converge into a single state of being. It is where one can start to answer life\u0026rsquo;s deepest questions—Why are we here? Where are we going? What does this all mean?—all within the comfortable, existential caress that nature provides.\nSo, shall you sit down under this shade, this lilim, with me?\n","date":"4 May 2021","permalink":"/lilim/001/","section":"Lilim","summary":"","title":"Lilim 001 — Lilim: A Weekly Newsletter on Philosophy, Art, and the Outdoors"},{"content":"Doing an annual review is an important part of my year. Once published, annual reviews can serve as cairns to mark the journey of life.\nThis year, I streamlined my process to make it more efficient. I wanted to put more intention into doing this because I will only do a few of them in my lifetime. I started doing them in 2013 when I was just 20 years old. If I continue to do them until I am 80 years old, I would be lucky to finish 52 more annual reviews. While I am strong and my memory is better, I would like to make the most of this yearly practice.\nSince 2019, I have been asking myself four questions to perform my annual review:\nWhat went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What am I working toward? What did I learn this year? I answer the first three questions for the four big areas of my life: health, relationships, sustenance (my financial and material life), and meaning (my vocation and art).\nSince this post is long overdue, let’s get right into it. Here is my 2020 annual review.\nWhat went well this year? #Health #My single biggest achievement in this area is taking care of whatever hearing is left to me so that my tinnitus does not increase in volume. Even more important is developing a healthier response to the noise, which eventually lead to habituation, or me getting used to the sound.\nThis is an important achievement as I consider my tinnitus similar (although less severe) than the biggest challenge I ever faced in my life: my 2011 depressive episode. More than a year since the ringing in my left ear started bothering me, I continue to cope with it. There are days when the sound seems louder than usual and, on these days, I sometimes ask myself when it will ever stop. But most days, I am able to function well and continue life as usual. I don’t even hear it sometimes, especially when I am so absorbed in whatever I am doing.\nThe second health achievement I am most proud of this year was losing 30 lbs or 13.6 kgs since starting a low-acid diet in August 2020. I was forced to do the diet after suffering from a throat problem caused by the reflux of stomach acid towards my upper esophagus. This condition is called Laryngopharyngeal reflux or LPR. To heal my throat, I needed to heal the sphincter that prevents the stomach acid to reflux into my esophagus. For this to happen, I needed to take some medications, remove acidic food in my diet temporarily, and lose weight. The diet I followed covered the last two goals. I ate only foods with pH levels 7 and above. As an added bonus, these foods also helped me lose weight.\nFollowing this diet meant giving up intermittent fasting, which is a habit I established last year and which, I considered my most important health goal back then. It is clear now that intermittent fasting wasn’t helping me control my weight (in fact, I was obese before my LPR) and, worse, it was messing up with my stomach acids. Today, I eat smaller but frequent meals and it has worked well for me.\nRelationships #Interestingly, the pandemic had a reverse effect on my relationship with Lea, my girlfriend. While it forced us to be apart (something we are thankful is finally over), our relationship actually thrive within those 300 days we were separated. Don’t get us wrong, being separated was not good for us; it would have destroyed us if it went further. However, a benefit of the separation was that it forced us to think creatively in maintaining our bond while away from each other. It created good habits that we still do even if we’re already together in person.\nDuring those 300 days we were apart, we had daily conversations in the evenings. We only missed a few, when I wasn’t at home. But most days, we would talk for about two hours each night. During our calls, we would play (thanks Houseparty!), review our day, settle problems, sing, write poems, and draw. Most importantly, the daily conversations helped us understand each other better. We were able to develop honesty and respect in our communication—something that isn’t easy not only because of the long-distance situation but also because of our personalities.\nAside from building my relationship with Lea, I was also able to build new relationships this year. This was primarily through Tungko ng Tula, a community of poets that was started by Rem Tanauan after the nationwide quarantine rolled out. Last December 30, 2020, the two batches of Tungko had a year-ender and one of the alumni, Cris Garcimo, used the word “daloy” (flow) to describe his experience of friendship in the community. Through Tungko, he met new friends, who, in turn, connected him with other friends. For him, Tungko became a critical node that opened up lots of streams of friendships. He was basically describing my own experience of Tungko. Through Tungko, I met interesting and genuine individuals, who, in turn, were connected with larger communities of like-minded and like-hearted people. The community made me feel less alone in 2020, a year when loneliness was at a record high worldwide.\nWhile I built new friendships, I was also able to nurture existing friendships. The pandemic deepened my relationships with a few close friends. Losing physicla connection encouraged many of us to seek alternative ways to connect via the Internet. If done right, these can actually be really great temporary replacements to physical connections. The pandemic forced me to start daily, weekly, and monthly habits that connect me to loved ones (a Zoom call with my sister tonight, another with cousins tomorrow, a weekly catchup with an accountability group every Wednesday, etc.) I wish that these habits will remain even after the pandemic.\nSustenance #Obviously, the pandemic was not easy for a lot of people’s finances and for the economy in general. However, like any disaster, the pandemic also proved to be a great wake up call for most people’s business and work life. Perhaps one of the pandemic’s most important lessons is that online-based work is more lockdown-proof than industries that rely heavily on physical contact. This is something I am very grateful for.\nWhile the pandemic led to economic loses, many of which were caused primarily by the sometimes excessive restrictions imposed on individuals and businesses to prevent the further spread of the disease, some industries were not profoundly hit. For example, students and academics continued their studies online and the influx of editing assignments I received have been consistently stable. This meant that I was in a good position to help family members, friends, and volunteer organizations as they coped with the economic effects of the pandemic.\nIn a previous post (How I Became a Professional Multipotentialite), I also showed that I have massively cut my working hours because of my new editing job. This is probably the best thing that happened to me in this area last year. This meant more free time for me to do projects that are not necessarily income-generating but are more aligned to what I want to do.\nMeaning #Living a meaningful life in 2020 was obviously challenging because of the pandemic. The biggest drawback for this year was that there was very little travel possible. Traveling was a big part of my life before the pandemic as most of the people I care about are far from me. Despite this, the restrictions, again, encouraged us to be more creative: we all needed to find ways to feel alive even when we were socially isolated. And that was what I did.\nThis year, I really dove into poetry. Most of the books I read this year were poetry books, and I finished the nine-week poetry master class, Tungko ng Tula. Reading and writing poetry led me to tinker with newspaper blackout poetry, which I immediately fell in love with. I tried it in English newspapers, Pangasinan magazines, and Filipino tabloids. Writing poetry was also the most social thing I did this year as it connected me with other poet friends. As a contribution to our community, I volunteered to design our website.\nLast 2019, I started going back to an old passion: drawing. And this year, I continued to draw. When the pandemic started, Robert Alejandro began a series of daily art classes. I joined one of these classes, and that started my drawing journey in 2020. I drew a series of blind contour drawings featuring Filipino comedians and personalities then international authors. I also drew my friends when they celebrated their birthdays.\nIn 2020, I also launched Mantaltaliwa, a Pangasinan newsletter that featured some of my Pangasinan poems and translations. I see it as my small contribution to the project of revitalizing and saving our dying mother tongue. I also started uploading videos I took while walking and riding my bike in Nature on YouTube and sharing these in my project Worn out Wheels.\nBut perhaps my biggest creative project in 2020 was immersing in Thoreau’s words. I read his entire journal for one year, translated entries that resonated with me into Filipino, shared these translations in social media, created a workshop on his life and creative processes, and tried out his field work process for about a month. Doing all these had a strong effect on my life as a writer as Thoreau taught me how to become truer to myself and to the things that really matter to me.\nAside from Thoreau, my biggest win this year was establishing a minimum viable life system. Starting in July 2020, I started exploring Caroline Miller’s goal-setting work book, which I coupled with Tiago Forte’s Annual Review process, which I converted into a mid-year review. Moving forward, I started learning a lot from Tiago’s work and built my own life management system, which totally changed how I function in a daily basis. The life system I established this year solved the problems I was struggling with for many years, and it has profoundly improved my sanity. It is still a work in progress. For example, this year, I moved from Evernote (the main app I was using) to Craft, which was a more beautiful note-taking app that has most of the things I need. I also streamlined my annual review process to be more efficient. I’ll be sharing more about my system in the future. What didn’t go so well this year? #Health #My tinnitus started bothering me in January 1, 2020, but that issue started back in 2019. It got bad because of a series of mistakes I made last 2019. While 2020 was the year it started bothering me, it was also the year of recovering from it—searching for help, trying out different therapies, finding what might help me, and sticking to what works.\nWhat really went bad for me in 2020 in terms of my health was the Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) I suffered starting August. LPR is when stomac acid travels up into the esophagus and eats up the throat. The most prominent symptom was a sensation of a fishbone in my throat, but I occassionally, I also experienced difficulty of breathing.\nLike my tinnitus, and like all other health issues, my LPR was the culmination of a lot of bad eating habits and choices: it probably started when I began intermittent fasting, which created extreme hunger, which gave me the license to overeat during meals. Because of overeating, I gained a lot of weight, leading to obesity, which placed a lot of pressure on my sphincter.\nObviously, things got better for me when I started correcting my diet, but good eating habits from the start could have prevented this health issue.\nRelationships #There were two things that didn’t go well for me in this area last 2020. First, my relationship with my younger sister got strained. We were not used to living in the same house—a reality we had to face after she was forced to stay with us indefinitely because of the pandemic. The differences between our personalities got out of hand and we arrived into a mutual understanding that we can no longer live in the ame house for that long again. I believe things will get better in the future. But for now, this is my reality, and I have learned to be comfortable with it.\nAnother thing that I think was a failure in this area was the death of two of our pets. While I have already made peace with this, I still believe I could have done better to prevent what happened. It was a learning experience. I became a more mindful pet owner after it. Now that I transferred to Laguna, I have decided not to keep pets for the time being, knowing how large a responsibility they actually are (and should be).\nSustenance #While I am grateful that this is an area of my life that is currently stable, I am also aware that I am not yet as resilient as I possibly can. I still need to establish alternative sources of income so that I have a financial safety net.\nMeaning #After doing Tiago Forte’s Annual Review, which I turned into a mid-year review, the biggest thing I realized from the process was that I was not really setting big, scary goals for myself. I was playing it safe. I wasn’t taking any risks. I forgave myself for this especially because 2020 was a particularly difficult year. But this 2021, I challenge myself to step up—to really do the work that I am called to do and to take more risks and expose myself to more challenges.\nWhat am I working towards? #Health #After going through a strict diet, I now have lost 30 lbs or 13.6 kgs. This was a big personal achievement, but it is still beyond my ideal weight. For the first quarter of 2021, I would like to achieve a more normal weight by dropping from 192.7 lbs (current) to 178 lbs, which means I have to lose 14.7 more lbs in about seven weeks. I would like to achieve this healthily and sustainably through healthy eating habits and regular physical activity.\nAside from this, my other goals are:\nI would like to totally prevent another onset of LPR. I would like to help my eardrum close to about 75% of its hole. I would like to continue tapering my psych meds this entire year without experiencing adverse effects. Overall, my intention for 2021 is not to have a serious health issue caused by my lifestyle choices. I would like to train myself to make better health choices every day.\nRelationships #My 2020 was a relationship-filled year, even when I was mostly isolated from people. I was able to build ties with new and old friends online. Now that I recently moved to Los Baños, I am looking forward to actually nurturing more of those relationships. I am also looking forward to being more intentional on the relationships that I build, hoping that they will support the mission I am pursuing.\nSustenance #For the past years, I have followed the books Your Money or Your Life (YMOYL) and Early Retirement Extreme (ERE) in thinking about and managing my money. While I still subscribe to the practices taught by these books, I have a growing curiosity on what alternative systems exist out there. I have read that Paul Jarvis, for example, does not resonate with the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) tradition that both YMOYL and ERE espouse. I wonder why that is the case.\nThis year, I would like to revisit my beliefs about money and restructure a system that works for me and helps me manage my financial goals and actions. In addition to this, I would like to look for another source of stable income, which will serve as my safety net in case editing projects come slow. I would also like to reconsider entrepreneurship so that I can align money-making with something I actually enjoy doing. Hopefully, I could be able to launch a product to test in the market before the year ends.\nMeaning #This 2021, as I am transitioning in a new place, I want to listen more to what my true self is telling me to pursue. Righ now, it is telling me to fully commit to developing my life system and philosophy of living further. To do this, I will have to establish a note-writing system—a daily practice of developing ideas into succinct, individual notes in the tradition of Niklas Luhmann’s zettelkasten and Andy Matuschak’s evergreen notes. I am considering publishing these notes as Borradores.\nMy hope is that through a daily practice of developing atomic ideas, I would sharpen my thinking so that I am more open to insight. My goal is to produce at least 300 fully developed notes. I have been dipping my toes in philosophy for the past three years. I think I am now ready to fully commit to this pursuit of truth and Ginhawa. This 2021, I would like to take more risks, to aim for scarier goals, as I thread through this field. To support me in this goal, I would also like to connect with people who are in a similar journey—pursuing truth and constructing their own philosophy of living as independent thinkers.\nAside from this, I also expect to finish translating all my favorite Thoreau journal quotes. By the end of 2021, I am hoping to have a first draft manuscript of Ang Talaarawan ni Thoreau, a collection con devotional of Thoreau journal quotes in Filipino.\nWhat did I learn this year? #To end my annual review, I’m going to share to you several of the most important insights and lessons I learned in 2020.\nYou may not be able to change something, but you can change your reaction to it. This is something I have already learned in the past. But once in a while, I need a tragedy to relearn it. Going through tinnitus, one thing that helped me cope with it mentally was when I realized that it was important for me to differentiate actions I can take to lessen the noise and actions I can take to improve my reaction to it. When I realized I can do a few things to lessen the noise (sleeping better, eating better, relaxing more) but not completely eliminate it, I was able to focus more on reducing my anxiety to it.\nSet scarier goals. Nothing is as awakening as realizing that you have played it safe for a long time. But this is what I realized the moment I did a mid-year review. My goals weren\u0026rsquo;t really scary enough to help me grow. While I still believe that the little things are what matters most, I also need challenges, once in a while, to help me learn more about myself. This year, I have set goals that are intentionally designed to help me grow.\nYou need a life system, not just a life philosophy. For a long time, I thought that what I was really building was a philosophy of living. However, as I was fixing my productivity system and information management system, I realized that a total integrated life management system is the ultimate project, and life philosophy is simply a part of that. Realizing that helped me define my priorities better.\nYou need project deadlines. I started putting deadlines on every goal and every project that I set. The deadlines are not fixed, strict, structural boundaries but rather reminders of what I can accomplish in a given time period. If I need more time, I simply use the deadline as a review time to redefine my thoughts on the project. Reframe all setbacks as challenges. There are no setbacks; only challenges. This has been a life-changing lesson for me in 2020, something that really helped me cope with everything that made the year unusually difficult. I thank William B. Irvine\u0026rsquo;s book The Stoic Challenge for reiterating this lesson to me.\nHappiness is generated by small actions, not big projects. After building my minimum viable system, I thought I would be the happiest person in the world. That was not the case. In fact, I felt an unexplained emptiness. This made me realize that one does not need a life system to be happy. It helps one be happy, but the heavy lifting comes in the form of habits and little actions that raise our overall well-being.\nAnd with that, I close another chapter of my life. Thank you 2020, and welcome 2021!\n","date":"26 January 2021","permalink":"/essays/2020-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2020 Annual Review"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/hero-books/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hero Books"},{"content":" When I have a little money, I buy books; and if I have any left, I buy food and clothes.\nErasmus\nWhen I was in grade school (like many of us at that time) I was broke. I had very little money. Whatever little money I had came from pocket change left from the 20–50 pesos that my father gave me every day. That didn\u0026rsquo;t change much in high school.\nOnce in a while, when my titas come home from abroad, I\u0026rsquo;ll grow about 10 times richer. They would hand out 10–20 dollars to us, their nephews and nieces, which we excitedly hand over to our parents who went to town to have them changed into pesos. I was so happy to have 500–1,000 pesos, which I was free to spend however I wanted.\nI almost never spent this money on food or clothes. After receiving the bills, I immediately knew where to go: the bookstore. I would buy random books. Because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about what to read (I was unaware of reviews back then, and internet access was not as available as it is now), I just chose a book based on its blurb and cover. That was how I learned how to be a reader and a writer.\nReading is my primary way of learning, and books are my go-to resources especially on the most important topics I am learning like philosophy, psychology, art, etc. Today, I continue to buy books and I have more money to do so. But I do more than simply buying and reading them.\nBack in 2018, I started tracking my reading. I kept a list of the best books I\u0026rsquo;ve read so far on specific topics. I also started my annual ritual of sharing my \u0026ldquo;hero books\u0026rdquo; of the year. And last 2020, I started keeping track of every single book I read.\nThe next step in my reading journey is probably to be more mindful about my reading. While reading is a wonderful activity, it has its drawbacks. As Arthur Schopenhauer writes:\nWhen we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process.\nSuch, however, is the case with many men of learning: they have read themselves stupid.\nIt is better to be a better thinker than to be a better reader. This is the reason why although I horde books in the past, I collect less of them now and actually consider myself a slow and selective reader.\nThat said, I\u0026rsquo;ll continue the tradition I started for myself. Here are my hero books of 2020.\nThe Diving Bell and the Butterfly | Jean-Dominique Bauby #I am not sure whether it was a good idea that I knew how the book was written before I started reading it. But I did. And I felt guilty reading it at my pace. I felt like I should have read it slower.\nThe book was written by someone who had locked-in syndrome, a condition where the brain stem has failed, making the person paralyzed throughout his body and unable to talk even if his other mental processes are normal. The author of the book, Bauby, was \u0026ldquo;fortunate\u0026rdquo; enough to still be able to move one eye. He used this eye to write the book.\nCollaborating with his speech therapist, they constructed a way that he could communicate. Anyone who would like to communicate with Bauby held a card containing the letters of the alphabet arranged according to their frequency of use. The person would start pointing the letters. Bauby would blink when the correct letter was reached. Through this slow process, he dictated this short but stunningly beautiful book about the meaning of life.\nIt was, for sure, a labor of love. The book was literally written letter by letter. I guess, knowing that made me truly appreciate the book. The book was on my shelf for a long time, but I decided to read it only when I found myself needing some consolation and inspiration after my tinnitus started early January last year.\nCoping with my tinnitus was not easy, but it was nothing compared to what Bauby had to go through until he died. And he was able to give birth to something so beautiful despite his condition. The book helped me go through one of the biggest challenges I faced in my life.\nReality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World | Jane McGonigal #I have always been a gamer. When I was a kid I never had my own Gameboy. But I would borrow one from my classmates for weeks. I would then save some money from my allowance to buy batteries so I can play Pokemon the entire weekend. In high school, I would play computer games with friends for a good amount of my lunch break, going to Math class late. I would stop playing games in college, save some NBA Live games.\nHowever, when I went through depression in 2011, games helped me cope with my condition. They helped me pass time as I waited for the medicines to take effect. In 2018, when my relationship of six years ended, one of my best friends hooked me into Underlords, a strategy game, which helped me move on. The same game accompanied me during a similarly difficult time last year when I haven\u0026rsquo;t habituated to my tinnitus yet. I continue to play the game today. It has become part of my daily routine.\nAside from the emotional benefits I experience from playing games, I have used games to enhance my mind and body coordination as well as my analytical skills. Granted, games have affected my sleep and I could get addicted to them if I let myself. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t. I limit myself to at most two hours of playing per day.\nDespite its huge role in my emotional and even creative life, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been proud of being a gamer. I have avoided mentioning it in this blog or in front of people. This book was the first book to ever convince me of coming out and being proud of my gaming history.\nThe main moral of the book is that the elements that make games pleasurable should actually be used to redesign our social systems and institutions (education, work, etc.) so that people enjoy engaging with their world more.\nThe Stoic Challenge: A Philosopher\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Becoming Tougher, Calmer, and More Resilient | William B. Irvine #I debated whether to include this book or not. The book was actually short and by no means dense. I feel like it could have been written as a blog post. Overall, I am not sure if this was a well-written book. However, I am including it in my hero books for the year because of the undeniable effect it has had on my life in the past months.\nThis is the second book I\u0026rsquo;ve read about stoicism. The first was Marcus Aurelius\u0026rsquo; Meditations. That book was full of wisdom but it was so hard to digest and, therefore, remember. On the other hand, I remember The Stoic Challenge so easily, because its main point can be summarized into a single sentence: Treat every setback as a challenge. This was the first book I read that treated and emphasized this as a viable strategy for life. That simple lesson has never left me. My tinnitus is a challenge. The deaths of my pets were a challenge. The pandemic is a challenge. They are all opportunities to practice my ability to maintain emotional equilibrium during tough situations.\nSwitching Languages: Translingual Writers Reflect on Their Craft | Steven G. Kellman #After Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s journal, this is easily the most important book I read this year. Finding the book was serendipitous. There was no way I could have read it if I didn\u0026rsquo;t find it in Booksale since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an ebook version.\nIt is an essential book because it helped me address one of the most perplexing problems I\u0026rsquo;ve ever had as a writer: In what language should I write?\nI am tempted to say that the book\u0026rsquo;s answer to this question is: All of them. But that will fail to capture all the nuances that come with being a multilingual English writer, something that the book was able to present so excellently.\nThe book is an anthology of essays written by multilingual writers from Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia, most of whom also wrote in English. The collection is an excellent representation of the condition of multilingual English writers worldwide.\nAfter reading the book, I felt less weird for experiencing this tension I have among the three languages I write in. I felt less alone. Throughout the world, even the most successful writers have grappled with the identity crisis that comes with speaking multiple languages. I still continue to struggle with my voice, but this book made me realize that I need to embrace this struggle rather than avoid it.\nMy voice is the collection of all the identities that I carry and the languages that come with them. I learned not to hate English for colonizing my mind or my mother tongue for not being rich or interesting enough. The languages I speak are my children. I need to take care of them. I need to let them talk to each other. This book helped me nurture the desire to demonstrate my multilingualism in the work that I do.\nThe Journal of Henry David Thoreau, 1837–1861 | Henry David Thoreau (edited by Damion Searls) #Last December 13, 2020, I finished reading Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s journal after an entire year of reading each of his entries for the day. I talked about the lessons I learned from this in another post.\nThoreau\u0026rsquo;s journal was the first journal by anyone, dead or alive, I have ever read in its entirety. It was instructive to see how a writer, a public figure, could differ from who he is in his most private moments. I felt I knew Thoreau well as a person after reading his biography. Reading his journal, I felt he was a friend.\nThe journal contains Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s evolution as a writer, his most private project to create what he called a \u0026ldquo;Kalendar\u0026rdquo; of natural phenomena, which he never published. It contains a mixture of science and poetry that helps one appreciate how much beauty there is in the world where Thoreau lived. The journal also contains his routines and his ideas about writing and the creative life. I am an entirely different artist—no, person—after reading this book.\nOther Great Reads #I read a lot of poetry last year that I can almost say that 2020 was a year of poetry for me. I immersed myself in that artform last year since I joined Tungko ng Tula, a course and community run by my friend Rem Tanauan. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably write about my year of poetry at a different time, but here are the poetry books I read this year as well as other great reads. For a complete list of the books I read in 2020, go here.\nSailing Alone Around the Room: New and Collected Poems by Billy Collins. This is the first Billy Collins collection I read. If you want to laugh and think about the meaning of life at the same time, read him. Rewiring Tinnitus: How I Finally Found Relief From the Ringing in My Ears by Glenn Schweitzer. This is the only book in Tinnitus I finished this year. I could have finished reading the two other books I read on the subject, but when I started feeling better, I just have to park the books and move on. That said, this book encouraged me to actually use meditation to habituate with the tinnitus. As always, meditation worked for me. Ochre Tones: Poems in English and Cebuano by Marjorie Evasco. Her name will forever be eclipsed by her son\u0026rsquo;s name (Joey Ayala), but Marjorie Evasco deserves a place of her own on the altar of verses. This is the only Filipiniana book I read this year (something I need to work more on). Misdiagnosed: One Woman\u0026rsquo;s Tour of—and Escape from—Healthcareland by Jody Berger. I read this book after going through another terrible experience with doctors. My distrust of the traditional medical system is growing by the day and Jody\u0026rsquo;s example was a great beginner\u0026rsquo;s guide to what lies beyond it. Selected Poems by Carl Sandburg. The thickest poetry book I read this year. Reading him was both fun and tiring. Sandburg was not afraid to experiment with form and to explore topics that are extremely turbulent and political. Newspaper Blackout by Austin Kleon. This is the book that encouraged me to try newspaper blackout poetry. I have done blackouts on the Watchtower magazine as well as the local Filipino tabloids. Winter Hours by Mary Oliver. Mary Oliver\u0026rsquo;s most intimate work by far. Reading her and Thoreau at the same time was a marvelous experience. Dept. of Speculation by Jenny Offill. I wanted to put this book on my list of top hero books for this year, but for some reason, I just can\u0026rsquo;t. Maybe because I need it to be life-changing or thought-provoking at least, but it failed in both. Nevertheless, the book was very, very surprising. It is the first book of its kind I\u0026rsquo;ve ever read: a very short novella made of very short chapters, which, in turn, are made of very short sentences and segmented thoughts. I want to write a similar book in the future! The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. After writing my short story Lurem, I was inspired to revisit my fantasy project. Part of going back to fantasy was, of course, reading fantasy. I intend to finish Tolkien\u0026rsquo;s major works. I\u0026rsquo;m done with The Hobbit and this first book of the trilogy. I\u0026rsquo;ll read the second and third books, as well as the Silmarillion, hopefully in the near future. And that\u0026rsquo;s it. Another reading year has ended. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to writing my third iteration of this post next year. I hope this post pointed you to some books you might check for your own reading list this 2021.\nMay your 2021 be full of joy and, well\u0026hellip;books!\n","date":"1 January 2021","permalink":"/essays/my-hero-books-of-2020/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My Hero Books of 2020"},{"content":"There are two ways that people approach creativity, either consciously or unconsciously:\nCreativity as a celebrity game Creativity as an authenticity game Neither is right or wrong. People who look at creativity through each lens are looking at it the right way. However, we have a cultural bias that favors the first option.\nFor example:\nIf you are a writer you need to get published. You need to win an award. People need to know about you. You have to live in public. You need to have x number of followers. You need to earn x number of income from royalties, etc. Again there is absolutely nothing wrong with all these goals. But we have to recognize that there exists a cultural bias over these goals, which have not always resulted in good things.\nSome examples:\nThe majority of people expect creatives to have a following. If they don’t have one, they’re just “hobbyists”, which is synonymous with being amateurs. Because society expects artists to have a following, many who have a creative itch are frightened by the prospect of engaging in the creative process. People leave their creative endeavors after burning out from trying so hard to “make it”. Many creatives sacrifice other important areas of their lives for the sake of \u0026ldquo;success\u0026rdquo;. What\u0026rsquo;s sadder about this is that society actually celebrates people who sacrifice everything just to be \u0026ldquo;great\u0026rdquo;. Society distinguishes between good art (“high art) and bad art (doodles, punk art, and the like) raising the barrier to entry for creative pursuits in certain circles too high for most people. Creativity is institutionalized and pigeonholed into hierarchies. The creative marketplace has transformed into a dog-eat-dog environment where you either make it or you die (sometimes, literally). The Celebrity Game #Much of society’s ideas of creativity and art revolve around the celebrity game. However, if you are an artist and you play the celebrity game, you have to face some hard facts:\nPeople’s attention has become more and more scarce over the years, thanks to the Internet and social media, which made the barrier to entry to content creation so low. Winning the celebrity game almost always requires you to compete. You have no choice about this. In specific instances, you can make it by playing the authenticity game but we shouldn’t forget the role of “luck” in these instances. Making it in the creative world just by being authentic is not the norm (for more on this, see the work of Nassim Nicholas Taleb). The Authenticity Game #The alternative of the celebrity game is of course the authenticity game. What is the authenticity game?\nAspire for authenticity first. Aspire for doing what feels good. Stop treating your art as the be-all and end-all of your life. Prepare for mild success (i.e., doing your best work based on your own standards, not that the standards of other people, and training yourself to be ready when “luck” works for you and you get a big break). When a celebrity opportunity arrives, remember to reflect on the cons, not just the pros. The Benefits of Obscurity #There are some benefits of obscurity. Austin Kleon said in Steal Like an Artist:\nSoon after, you learn that most of the world doesn’t necessarily care about what you think. It sounds harsh, but it’s true. As the writer Steven Pressfield says, “It’s not that people are mean or cruel, they’re just busy.\nThis is actually a good thing, because you want attention only after you’re doing really good work. There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent. No hangers-on.\nYou’ll never get that freedom back again once people start paying you attention, and especially not once they start paying you money.\nEnjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it.\nThis is where I admire Thoreau so much. Yes, he was able to make a name for himself while he was alive, but he was never a big hit like J.K. Rowling was or similar big names in literature. Even when he started gaining traction in writing books and lecturing, he always recognized the tension between fame and his desire to be authentic in the work that he does.\nFor example, he stopped giving lecture tours when he noticed that they took away the time he spends in nature and when he noticed that his audience were just looking for formulaic presentations that forced him to be inauthentic just to please them. Furthermore, his journal was done in private and was never really meant to bring him fame. And yet he viewed it as his most important work.\nI’m sure there are other examples of artists who played the authenticity game rather than the celebrity game game.\n","date":"27 December 2020","permalink":"/essays/celebrating-obscurity/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Celebrate Obscurity"},{"content":"In Henry David Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s 26 September 1859 letter to one of his most avid readers, Harrison Gray Otis Blake, he wrote the following:\nIn short, you’ve got to carry on two farms at once,—the farm on the earth and the farm in your mind.\n\u0026ldquo;The farm on the earth\u0026rdquo; was Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s poetic representation of one\u0026rsquo;s livelihood, one\u0026rsquo;s source of income, while \u0026ldquo;the farm in your mind\u0026rdquo; is as it sounds_—_a figurative representation of that place where one\u0026rsquo;s ideas are planted, cultivated, and grown.\nComparing the two farms, Thoreau said,\nIt is easy enough to maintain a family, or a state, but it is hard to maintain these children of your brain (or say, rather, these guests that trust to enjoy your hospitality), they make such great demands; and yet, he who does only the former, and loses the power to think originally, or as only he ever can, fails miserably. Keep up the fires of thought, and all will go well.\nAside from comparing his work with farming or gardening, Thoreau has also compared his explorations of the natural world to harvesting. After hearing the sound of flail for several mornings in August 1854, he wrote in his journal:\nIt leads me to ask if I have spent as industrious a spring and summer as the farmer, and gathered as rich a crop of experience. If so, the sound of my flail will be heard by those who have ears to hear, separating the kernel from the chaff all the fall and winter, and a sound no less cheering it will be. If the drought has destroyed the corn, let not all harvests fail. Have you commenced to thresh your grain? The lecturer must commence his threshing as early as August, that his fine flour may be ready for his winter customers.\nThis morning, as I woke up on a chilly morning, as I have been for about a week or so already, gray clouds covering the Cordillera, I felt deep gratitude for my work_—_sitting down, morning after morning, reading a few pages, then writing, drawing, or translating on my journals. I realized that whatever I have now is the most ideal life I could ever have. The work that I do is what I want to do, and it is also the life I want to live.\nLike Thoreau, I am a gatherer of perpetual seeds of thoughts from other artists_—songs, poems, essays, books, drawings, photographs, letters, quotes, movies, scientific findings, philosophical arguments. And then I bring these seeds home to my journals (both digital and analog), where I nurture and cultivate them through revisiting them. By doing so, I become a farmer, a gardener, of the children of my mind, which, in turn, grow into my own ideas—_or, more accurately, my own rendering of already existing ideas. Sometimes (or most of the time), I can\u0026rsquo;t even take ownership of them for while I plant and cultivate them, it is the Muse, that mysterious part of the brain I prefer to call the Subconscious, which seem to make them grow.\nThis is what I would like to call, the \u0026ldquo;Orchard of Ideas\u0026rdquo;. Every artist has one. You put all these orchards together and you basically get the \u0026ldquo;Wilderness of Ideas\u0026rdquo;, where people could borrow or even steal wild seeds that they can replant and reuse in their own orchards.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a drawing I made this morning to illustrate these ideas:\n","date":"29 November 2020","permalink":"/essays/an-orchard-of-ideas/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"An Orchard of Ideas"},{"content":"The film Paterson inspired me to write a poem after a long time of not being able to do so. For anyone who hasn’t seen the movie (you should), it is about a poet who writes really good poems but doesn’t want to publish them. It is a great parable for the tension between the artist as the Self and the artist as a performer.\nWhat really struck a chord in me was how the poet existed in his everyday life. I felt like he had poetry goggles: everything he saw and experienced was fodder for his art.\nA Way of Seeing #At about the same time, I listened to an interview with Alain de Botton about his unconventional way of writing philosophy. When asked what he thinks philosophy was, he said that it is a way of seeing things rather than a topical category. What I understood from his perspective was that things don’t become philosophical just because they are concerned with problems like, perhaps, the existence of God or the soul. They become philosophical because we look at them then talk about them in a manner that is philosophical—we ask, we reflect, we extrapolate, we provide arguments, then we make conclusions. Philosophy is about a way of seeing things than a way of saying them.\nI think the same can be said about poetry. The hero of Paterson (who, by the way, was a man named Paterson living in a place called Paterson—what poetry!) saw everything as poetic. Then he described what he saw through poetic language. What was amazing about Paterson was that he can’t remove that lens through which he saw things. It was built-in and, therefore, defined every single moment of his existence.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Here\u0026rdquo; #My gut says that there is just a subtle difference between seeing the world in a poet’s lens and seeing it in a philosopher’s lens. It is subtle because I believe, based on my own experience, that both lenses really want to make sense of the world and our relationship with it. Both lenses are existential. The biggest difference between the two is objectivity and subjectivity. While the philosopher desires primarily to see what is really “there”, the poet desires primarily to see what is really “here”. In other words, the philosopher hungers to know about reality. The poet hungers to know about how we experience that reality.\nAnd this translates with how the poet and the philosopher “say” things. When I am wearing my philosopher’s lens, I am primarily interested in accuracy. I am careful not to make claims hastily, I use direct language, I am more humble and honest, and I don’t say I am sure about something I am not.\nOn the other hand, when I am wearing my poet’s lens, I care more about authenticity than I am about accuracy, I am fine with sacrificing carefulness for genuineness, I use metaphors, and I don’t care about making grand claims about things I am not sure about. It is okay for me to lie if that means I am able to be true to my experience.\nPhilosophy and Poetry are Complementary #Of course, it is not impossible to take on both lenses. In fact, they are complementary. In my quest for truth, philosophy is my primary lens. It is more honest and careful. It is more trustworthy. But in transmitting that truth to others, I use the poet’s lens (or perhaps more accurately, the poet’s microphone), because poetry’s strength lies in the way it says the truth. I can still be accurate in my description of truth, I can still be careful, but I can also be freer and more colorful in my description of it. I can be more poetic.\nIn both cases, philosophy and poetry cease to be topical categories boxed inside academic departments. They become ways of living—a personal religion if you will. And, in fact, what they really are are simply descriptions of innate capabilities we are born with—two ways of operating that define what makes us human.\n","date":"22 November 2020","permalink":"/essays/seeing-then-saying/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Seeing Then Saying"},{"content":"I do believe in the pursuit of truth. And I do appreciate the power of debates in uncovering the truth. But this world is a tough world—and not everybody is prepared to enter the world of philosophical debates.\nMuch of what philosophy is about is \u0026ldquo;being sure about what is really there\u0026rdquo; (facts) and differentiating it from \u0026ldquo;what we want to be there\u0026rdquo; (subjective values). To be honest, being very sure about what is really there is not really that necessary in living \u0026ldquo;a good life\u0026rdquo;. Some of the happiest people are not necessarily the most philosophical. You can die happy even if you lived an unexamined life. You can die happy even if your entire belief system is built on a lie. This, I think, is even the norm. Most people will be able to go on with life even without challenging their assumptions about the world.\nBut for a select few, understanding what is \u0026ldquo;truly there\u0026rdquo; has a profound influence on their sense of well-being. They need to know the facts before they define their values and, therefore, before they define their actions. This, they think, is what a life of integrity is about: knowing what you are doing and why you are doing them. And integrity, for these people, is an essential ingredient for a good life.\nI sympathize with them. I was once asked by a friend why I even bothered asking questions about life and existence. He asked what I was trying to achieve from it. Why not just live and let go of all the thinking? I did not expect someone to question my intentions in being philosophical. As far as I could remember, I was naturally inquisitive about the \u0026ldquo;deep stuff\u0026rdquo; ever since I was a child. It is what I have been doing even before I learned the word \u0026ldquo;philosophy\u0026rdquo;. It made me happy and lessened my anxiety knowing that I understood the world I was living in. It is a personal preference that I feel uncomfortable justifying to other people.\nBut I also get why my friend was asking about my intentions. People who are philosophical need to be scrutinized for their intentions. Why are they spending all their energy thinking about problems that may never even be solved? And why do some of them feel like it is their greatest crusade to show people how wrong they are?\nI think it is natural for us to share our truth—to make other people know our truth so they can finally get to \u0026ldquo;see us\u0026rdquo;. I feel the same way. But there is a difference between speaking your truth and evangelizing it to the point that you feel that it is your divine mission to put the other on an opposing side.\nSome people do this, and while I sincerely think that they are doing it with good intentions, they are probably welcoming more unnecessary stress in their lives than they can possibly handle (not to mention the stress they put on others).\nThe truth is, we can never truly convince anyone. People convince themselves. What we can do is either force them to convince themselves or facilitate that transformation through the careful and subtle expression of our innermost beliefs. This is why I am thinking about exploring how I can express my ideas about the world through poetry, personal essays, and fantasy fiction, instead of direct language in contexts like philosophical debates.\n","date":"15 November 2020","permalink":"/essays/why-use-poetry-and-story-to-explore-philosophy/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"On Using Poetry and Story-telling to Express Your Beliefs"},{"content":"About a week ago, my good friend Rem Tanauan, a great poet himself whose work has profoundly influenced my own creative life, sent me this article that features an interview with Billy Collins, dubbed “the most popular poet in America”.\nRem and I are fans of his poems because they are conversational, witty, humorous, and down-to-earth. These are the kind of poems we want to see more of and some of our poems were definitely influenced by Billy Collin’s voice.\nRem asked me to share with him my thoughts on the article. What resulted was a brain dump of my ideas on building a new culture and community of poets in the Philippines.\nI thought I would share them with you today. Poetry is the most freeing art form I know and discovering it had a profound effect on my mental health and quality of life. It is a great complement to the equally important work I do in philosophy.\nIn this post, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on several quotes from the article.\nEnjoy.\nYou Are the Ultimate Judge of Your Work #I’ll start with this quote from the article:\nI say, Get rid of it. Because if it got into a later poem it would be Scotch-taped on. It would not be part of the organic, you know, chi, the spine that the poem has, the way it all should be one continuous movement. Poems that lack that seem very mechanically put together, like a piece here and a part there.\nThe context of this quote is that Billy Collins is advocating that poems be written in one sitting. He writes them in 20-40 minutes and only returns to them after a few weeks to do some minor edits. According to him, writing poems in one sitting creates a more organic poem that has “one continuous movement”. This, he said, is more desirable than poems that are “mechanically put together.\u0026quot;\nWhile I sympathize with his advice, and I do write poems in one sitting, I have some reservations for what he said here partly because I do blackout poetry and by their nature blackout poems are scotch-taped poems. Their mechanical nature is what makes them different. The reason why I like them is that I don’t have to stress a lot about being original when I do them. I might experience some stress when looking for patterns between words, but at least I am taking a rest from the stress of trying to be original all the time.\nOf course, it isn’t impossible for a blackout poem to suddenly emerge like a typical poem, which has the characteristic of having \u0026ldquo;one continuous movement\u0026rdquo; (what he describes here as “chi\u0026quot;). However, what if a poem doesn’t have this? Is it a bad poem? Was my process for coming up with it a wrong way of doing poetry even if I enjoyed doing the process?\nThese questions led me to think about how we actually judge a poem. We can criticize a poem by not having this element of chi but isn’t our criticism of that poem subjective, based on our biases and tastes? Heck, aren’t all our judgments of art subjective?\nOne reason why I think this is an important question to answer is that I actually believe (and I share this with Rem and most of our poet friends) that poetry, or any other art for that matter, should ONLY be done with the purpose of enriching our quality of lives, not to diminish joy or the feeling of “ginhawa” (a Filipino concept of integral well-being, which I’ll loosely translate here into “bliss\u0026quot;) that is inherent in all creative pursuits. Now, what if a poet wrote a mechanical poem but did so “blissfully\u0026quot;? Do we say that his work is not good just because it was mechanical? Whose standards are we using to judge the work?\nThis made me think that, perhaps, by describing how writing poetry happens, we are actually prescribing a “right way” to write poetry. If so, how different would we be from formalists who have tried to proselytize “one way” of doing poetry?\nUltimately, I asked myself, “If blissful writing is the organizing principle, who is the ultimate judge of a poet’s work?\nThe way I see it, there are only two judges:\nThe poet himself Other people (other poets who believe in writing blissfully, other poets who don’t share the value of blissful writing, and general readers) I thought about how this judgment process happens and constructed the following table:\nFrom this meditation, I realized that the ultimate judge of any poem is the poet him/herself. The reason for this is that any definition of success is always subjective first before it is objective. Any group can impose particular standards of what a good poem is that its members can agree on. But these standards are not necessarily the standards of an individual. So even if feedbacks are helpful, even if objective standards have their use in communities, a poet or an artist needs to trust his own standards first so he can trust his own abilities.\nAny community of poets who would claim to be an alternative to business-as-usual should embrace this attitude. Though feedback is very much needed from fellow poets and the general audience, these should not replace the most important judge or feedback-giver of all: oneself. This is because if a poet does not learn how to trust himself, he won’t be able to produce any work. And according to Billy Collins, from the same article, the most important thing is that a poet writes.\nActually, I don’t think you can be really badly influenced by anyone, as long as it makes you write.\n\u0026ldquo;Did You Feel Good While Writing?\u0026rdquo; #This brings me to my next meditation. As a thought experiment, imagine that a highly intellectual and conceptual formalist poet wanted to join the alternative community of blissful poets. She said she wanted to join because she liked the group’s emphasis on feeling joy throughout the creative process. By leaving the dog-eat-dog culture behind, she hopes to experience a different relationship with her writing. She immediately experiences what she is looking for because there are no strong standards or harsh judgments in the group.\nHowever, here’s the problem: She still writes highly intellectual, highly formal, and highly conceptual poems that are not blissful for readers. When this was brought to her attention, she said this is the only way she knows how to write. This is the writing that makes her feel good. What will be the right response in this situation? Will the community of blissful poets banish her for failing to write more intuitive and down-to-earth poems? If this is the response that the community gives, is it still true to its principle of blissful creativity? Is it still facilitative, or is it already prescriptive?\nFor me, the answer is clear. For a poetry group to truly exemplify the principle of “ginhawa”, it should be a space where there are fewer and fewer constraints. To quote the Tao Te Ching here:\nThe more restrictions and prohibitions there are,\nThe poorer the people will be.\nLesser rules mean that there is more space for ALL kinds of poetry. Even the super formalist poems should be welcomed. Experimental poems should be welcomed (like blackouts). Intellectual poems should not be looked down on. This means that the alternative community of blissful poets becomes a space of true freedom. It does not prescribe strongly on anything. If there is any prescription, an organizing principle that binds everything, it is only this:\n“Did you feel good while writing? Ok. That’s it.”\nIf you add on that, then you add constraints that could muddle the very essence of what “feeling good” is. The subjective blissful experience of an individual poet should be the ultimate principle.\nFreedom in Poetry #The role of freedom in poetry was nicely said by Collins in this quote in the article:\nI grew by allowing aspects of myself that I had previously excluded into the poetry. I think all poets—younger poets particularly—have a private sense of decorum, meaning they feel there are certain things they should write about and other things they shouldn’t.\nMy dream is for poetry to be freeing, and if a community should be a space for free poetry, it needs to evolve into that place where poets are free to explore the different parts of themselves, where no topic is out of the conversation and no form is out of experimentation. Of course, there are intricacies of this and we shouldn’t expect any community of poets to immediately be like this. But it’s a nice dream.\nI also think that this should be one of the main goals of any critique of traditional poetry. To be truly an alternative way, alternative poetry has to be freeing. It should, as much as possible, prevent creating rules on what should be and what shouldn’t be explored. It would be nice to see that each poet of such a group is exploring their own topics and their own structures and there should be a venue for them in the community to show their work. They should be given the time to share during gatherings or they should be given a platform where they can share their discoveries. They should be given a voice and there shouldn’t be censorship at all.\nA Solo Act #All of these ties well with the general subject of the tension between an individual’s need for community and his need for authenticity. Here is an interesting quote from the article that jumps into this:\nFor me poetry was always a solo act. A romantic idea maybe, but I thought that poetry was something you did in solitude, and the idea of sharing your work with anybody was completely antithetical to what I thought poetry was all about.\nI think the challenge for any community of blissful poets is how it can be a place where camaraderie does not muddle with the solitude that poetry requires. How can poets be \u0026ldquo;alone together\u0026rdquo;? How can the community be a space where an individual’s need for community and the need for authenticity is both fulfilled?\nKeep Your Center #In ending, I think I want to highlight again this tension between the poet as the Self and the poet as a member of a group. In the article, Billy Collins sees this tension:\nThe image one has to present as a performer, as an interviewee and whatnot, is a very different self from the sensibility that actually creates the poems. You need to keep your center, the part that writes the poems, and not spin off into popularity.\nI have been meditating on this for a very long time. Every time I show up to the world, a part of me is lost. This is expected. But what I wish to have is a community, a space where the potential damages of sharing my work with others are lessened or minimized, a sort of creative insurance.\nBuilding a new culture and community of poets in the Philippines who believe that creativity does not have to always be competitive and harsh is hard. Any such endeavor needs to prioritize the maintenance of a safe space where every individual member is an asset. What I shared above are my thoughts on how this might be done.\nMy friend Rem plans to reopen his poetry course and community of blissful poets, “Tungko ng Tula”, by January 2021. If you want to discover a different kind of poetry or just curious about anything I shared in this article, I encourage you to visit Rem’s IG page @ditomuna. Read his beautiful tanaga poems (four lines, seven syllables) and while you’re at it, send him a message.\nThe course and community also have a website at tungkongtula.com, which is currently only written in Filipino.\n","date":"1 November 2020","permalink":"/essays/the-challenges-of-building-a-new-culture-and-community-of-poets/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"The Challenges of Building a New Culture and Community of Poets"},{"content":"All of us are travelers.\nEven for the many of us who spend most of their time at home (pandemic or not), we are traveling.\nWe are traveling the longest, most picturesque travel we can take: the journey of life itself.\nAlong this journey, we tread to valleys and peaks, and most of these look a lot like the next valleys and peaks that we will be walking through. The only way we can get through these future valleys and peaks is to remember how we got to similar situations in the past.\nWhat are you doing to help yourself remember?\nAlso, as we stay longer in this journey of life, we realize that travelers join us, younger and less experienced travelers who badly need someone to guide them along their own path. You know you have the knowledge that they can use to survive the journey. But will you remember your hard-earned wisdom when it\u0026rsquo;s time for you to impart them to those who need them the most?\nThese questions suggest that we all need markers, cairns that mark specific spots we reached along our journey. When we build these cairns, they serve not just as a reminder for ourselves but as a lesson for those who are yet to go through the things we already went through.\nKnowing this, I have endeavored to write annual reviews every end-of-the-year. Since I started in 2013, I have written seven reviews that serve as cairns for myself and for anyone who might use them. When I relaunched my blog in 2017, I chose not to include my old annual reviews from 2013-2016. However, recently, as I\u0026rsquo;m starting to forget how much I have gone through in the past years and as I meet more people who could use some help in the same subjects and challenges that I went through, I decided to republish them here.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sharing them in this newsletter with anyone who might be interested to read them.\nHere are the annual reviews and some synopsis on what they contain.\nMy 2019 Annual Review\nReviews the different achievements and major shifts I went through in 2019 including practicing intermittent fasting, transitioning to editing as my major livelihood, returning to drawing, reading Thoreau, and finding a new relationship after going through a breakup. It also tells about my struggles with tinnitus. My 2018 Annual Review\nTalks about the grieving process I went through after ending a six-year-long relationship. Also shares my first attempts in establishing daily creative routines to explore new passions like poetry, photography, translation, and philosophy. My 2017 Annual Review\nTells about how I found different communities that support my different passions (a writing community, a meditation community, and a permaculture community). It also talks about my relaunch of this website, my attempts (and, again, failures) to live a sustainable life, and my first serious encounter with the mind-blowing world of philosophy. My 2016 Annual Review\nShares about a year full of books—books that helped me understand my place in the bigger scheme of things, specifically in the material world, and how this relates to my attempt to create a fulfilling creative life. My 2015 Annual Review\nNarrates my adventures (and failures) in my first attempt to live in Metro Manila for an extended period of time, which led me to go back home to the province to recuperate and give more time to my creative pursuits. Tells about a year filled with travels and “spiritual” discoveries. My 2014 Annual Review\nReviews the ups and downs (mostly downs) of my first year after college. It also contains goals that I set myself for 2015. My 2013-2014 Annual Review\nTells about the different challenges I faced the first year after college. It also narrates how I tackled the question, “What will I do with my life?” which led me to start a blog and work online. Please forgive my subpar writing in these reviews, especially in the first ones. I edited them very minimally before publishing because I want to preserve my former way of thinking and writing. That is their purpose anyway: to be a time capsule of past mental states.\nWhether you read the reviews or not, I hope you appreciate the importance of keeping track of your own life journey, whether through annual reviews, journaling, oral history recordings, or photographs.\nJust build some form of marker that will help you remember the journey. You will need it when things get tough.\n","date":"16 October 2020","permalink":"/essays/cairns-to-mark-the-journey/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Cairns to Mark the Journey"},{"content":"I parked my bike under the shade of a small stout tree. It looks small from where I am standing because I am elevated around three or four feet from its roots. I am standing on concrete. This path has been cemented in the past year or so and this tree is one of the few lucky ones to avoid the teeth of the chainsaw. I am grateful for it for I was yet to attach the stand on my bike. I rested my bike on its rough trunk.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s 6:30 pm. Everything was already dark. The days have been shorter and the evenings longer. I have to readjust my afternoon rides if I want to catch the sunset—a feat I find so difficult to do. I have gotten so used to going out at 6 pm that I’ve forgotten it is no longer March.\nI looked at the large lights from afar. They are lights on the highway across this vast field of dark green. Smaller lights moved below these larger lights—one after the other like bowling balls.\nA feeling started to seep in while I saw all of these—the feeling that I’ve had since this morning and which I tried to escape from. It is the feeling that I am “still” lacking something—a feeling of failed expectations.\nFamiliar Doldrums #Today marks the end of several months of trying to construct a life system—an integrated productivity, knowledge management, and total life system. It has been a fulfilling, revealing, and exciting project to build. It’s much needed too because for so long I have been unable to organize my life in a way that totally made sense to me. Being someone who admires and “needs” organization, not being able to do this meant years of procrastination and psychological stress. I was able to address this mental burden in the past three months or so and I have a functioning minimum viable life system to show for it.\nI know that it is already achieving what it was built to do because I am feeling less anxious about it. I am ready to move on for the next project.\nBut then, I was surprised to find myself in these familiar doldrums at the end of large pursuits. I first experienced the doldrums after launching -Tanaw, the free ebook I created by compiling the answers of several awesome people on three questions that I was pondering on. I expected a feeling of jubilation, of joy, of rupture at the end of the project, only to find myself in a place of bland emptiness. This feeling always left me doubting myself and my efforts. It makes me feel like I wasted all my time doing something that wasn’t giving me the happiness I expected it to provide. I know that swimming and diving into this feeling would leave me afraid of pursuing new projects that may also fail to make me happy, so I try to avoid this feeling, to escape it, and to move on.\nBut the feeling won’t go. And I have grown old enough to know that feelings like these won’t go unless they’re confronted head on.\nWhat Truly Makes Us Happy #Looking at the large and small lights from afar made me realize (or, more accurately, made me remember the lesson I learned months ago from Laurie Santos’ enlightening course “The Science of Well-being.\u0026quot;\nThe things we think will make us happy are not the “direct” paths to happiness. Usually, they are simply scaffoldings that allow happiness to possibly emerge. But by themselves, they will not generate the feelings we are asking them to generate.\nI felt empty because I was looking for a quick fix to all my emotional hurdles (many of which were worsened by the pandemic). I completely forgot that happiness is so fleeting that it needs to be revisited constantly, generated not by big projects but by small actions and habits.\nWhat are these habits?\nHere’s a wallpaper created and shared by a fellow student of the course listing the habits that generate happiness. It is the wallpaper I use for my phone.\nExercising, eating, and sleeping well. Food, being physical, has a direct influence on our mental states. This is the reason why eating certain foods can make us feel groggy while eating others make our minds sharper. Likewise, exercising and sleeping enough a day have direct effects on our mental well-being. This is so obvious but we don’t always make these three things our priority. Taking time. Our society has glorified material affluence when what really makes us happy, according to science, is time affluence. Material affluence should allow us to have more time because this is what matters more—the freedom to do what we want to do when we want to do it or the freedom of just not doing anything at all! Being too busy is not always good for us. Being grateful. Gratitude has an immense influence on our general well-being, so immense that even writing a gratitude letter to someone you love and reading that aloud in front of him/her in person could raise your well-being by a large margin for more than a month! Meditating. Meditation is something that a lot of people are unwilling to do. Two reasons prevent them from exploring this powerful tool: it is difficult and it is frequently associated with Eastern religious beliefs. Fortunately, one can benefit from meditation without having to light an incense or sing chants. It is also not as difficult to do as some teachers describe it. Even reconnecting with one’s breath for a second can have massive effects on one’s internal state. I have so much to say about this but will leave it for a future post. Connecting. Connecting with loved ones and striking up conversations with strangers have a direct impact on our happiness, according to science. Granted, it is not easy to take care of this area of our life (or at least, for introverts like me, it isn’t easy). But taking care of our social connections especially during this time of social distancing is critical in preventing depression and other mental health problems. If you are a natural connector, you have a duty to build spaces where people can connect during these difficult times. Savoring. Savoring correlates with meditating. Savoring is like bringing the spirit of meditation into every important moment of one’s life (if we are being truly honest, this means every single moment of our life!) Whether it’s looking longer on the leaves falling from a tree, eating slower to connect with every taste in our food, or making the most of the days we spend with the little children in our lives (who will soon be teenagers and adults!), savoring directly generates happiness. The science shows that once these tiny actions are covered, a person should expect his or her well-being to drastically improve. But the linchpin is to turn these into habits—actions we repeat and revisit. The reason why we need to continuously do them is because of the very nature of positive mental states like happiness or flow. Like any emotion really, happiness is fleeting. It shows up then goes. We know it’s good for us so it has to be pursued but we need to make some effort. Fortunately, these habits are small and doable as compared to the big projects that we are expecting will make us happy (getting married, buying a new car, getting a raise, etc.)\nThe Right Goals #We don’t realize this often but there’s a big possibility that we are going after the wrong goals or maybe the goals we set for ourselves are good and worthy goals but we are expecting a lot from them or we are expecting the wrong things from them.\nBuilding a productivity system, I learned, produces a sense of control and calm. Building it is still a worthy pursuit. I will share my journey in building it at another time.\nHowever, building a life system doesn\u0026rsquo;t make one happy at least in a way that one expects. It is still possible to build a life system and feel awful afterward (like what happened to me) because the feeling of being in control and hitting one task after another in an organized way is not a direct path to happiness. It helps construct a place where positive emotions can flourish. But, by itself, it does not necessarily enhance well-being.\nWhat enhances well-being are habits—the tiny little actions that we do and revisit regularly, which reconnect us with the mental states that we’re looking for. These actions are the content that fills up whatever life system we build for ourselves.\nNow that I have a minimum viable life system in place, it\u0026rsquo;s time to make good use of it by pursuing the more important goals that directly translate to happiness.\nYesterday, I messaged my tribe asking them to set aside time twice a month for an accountability call. This regular meeting will definitely increase my well-being. It took me just five minutes to set something that I know will make me happy for the weeks to come. Compare that to the three or more months I spent fixing my system!\nRaising the level of our well-being, especially as we continue to tread through this pandemic that has been very, very long is the most critical project we should all engage in in the following months. It is what I choose to dedicate my time next. As always, I will write about my learnings and share them with you.\nThank you for always reading and I hope this has been useful.\n","date":"16 September 2020","permalink":"/essays/feeling-empty-after-finishing-a-big-project/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Feeling Empty After Finishing A Big Project"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/book-summaries/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Book Summaries"},{"content":"My overall impression of this classic is that it is overrated. Perhaps with this, I am really judging the translation because it was a pretty hard read even when I\u0026rsquo;m someone who is actually used to reading hard, academic books. I read Robin Hard\u0026rsquo;s translation, which featured an introduction and selected correspondences between Marcus Aurelius and his teacher, Marcus Fronto. I really don\u0026rsquo;t expect my impression to change much even if I read a different translation.\nDespite this, I think it was a great gateway to the philosophy of Stoicism and I did found a few valuable lessons on how to live life from the book. Interestingly, some of these are lessons I first learned from reading Eastern philosophy. This convinces me all the more that the themes in the art of living are universal.\nAlso, Marcus had a couple of really weird and quirky metaphors that struck me. These hidden gems provided the much needed comic relief to a rather dull and monotonous ancient book.\nHere are, in my opinion, the Meditations\u0026rsquo; greatest hits delivered through direct quotes, paraphrases, and commentaries.\nBook 2 #2.2 Fuckin\u0026rsquo; grow up dude!\n2.5, 2.11 Perform every action as though it is your last. (I find this really interesting. We\u0026rsquo;re more familiar with the modern adage, \u0026ldquo;Live this day as if it was your last.\u0026rdquo; Marcus intensified this by encouraging us to focus on the tiniest unit of life—our actions. Frequent awareness of one\u0026rsquo;s mortality is a constant topic throughout the Meditations and it is a happiness practice that modern positive psychology supports.)\n2.11 Things that happen to both good and bad people are not innately good or bad. They just happen. This is similar to a belief I am partial to called \u0026ldquo;ethical nihilism.\u0026rdquo;\n2.12 Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of death.\n2.14 The present moment is all that matters. (Mindfulness is not just a Buddhist concept!)\n2.17 Philosophy is a practical guide to life.\nBook 3 #3.1 Don\u0026rsquo;t procrastinate. Death can happen anytime and old age will make it impossible for you to do what you want to do\n3.4 Comparing yourself to others deprive you of the energy you could use to work on yourself.\n3.11 Approach life methodically. This is where Marcus laid down his process of thinking.\nBook 4 #4.3 You don\u0026rsquo;t need to retreat to a place. You can easily retreat within yourself.\n4.7 If you give up victimhood, you stop being a victim.\n4.11 See things as they truly are.\n4.19 Thinking about your legacy is idiocy. Those who will remember you after you die will themselves die eventually. And even if your legacy continues, come on, your\u0026rsquo;re dead! What use is that to you?\n4.20 \u0026ldquo;Is this necessary?\u0026rdquo; Ask this to actions and ideas. If the answer is \u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; eliminate.\n4.31 Love the art that you have learned and take your rest in it.\n4.32 The returns should determine the amount of effort you put on any activity.\n4.36 Universal nature is all about changes. (\u0026ldquo;Change\u0026rdquo; is not just a Chinese concept!)\n4.39 Nothing is bad on its own. Your mind creates value judgments: statements about things being bad or good. This is a very amoralist stance which is similar to the Buddhist concept of nonjudgment.\nBook 5 #5.3 Never mind the opinion of others. Follow your own mind.\n5.5 Be grateful of your qualities and talents.\n5.6 Do something good then move on. No need to announce or boast it.\n5.11 Ask yourself this always: \u0026ldquo;To what purpose am I presently using my soul?\u0026rdquo;\n5.16 \u0026ldquo;Where it is possible to live, there it is also possible to live well.\u0026rdquo;\n5.20 The obstacle is the way. (This is where Ryan holiday took it!)\n5.23 Everything pass including your troubles. So chill.\n5.28 \u0026ldquo;You are angry with a man if he smells of stale sweat, or has bad breath? What good will it do you? He has such a mouth, he has such armpits; and being as they are, such exhalations are bound to arise from them. \u0026lsquo;Yes, but the man is endowed with reason, and if he would only think, he could recognize his fault.\u0026rsquo; Gracious me, you have reason too, so set his powers of reason to work by making use of your own! Show him his fault, call it to his attention; for if he listens, you will cure him, and there will be no need for anger.\u0026rdquo; (Haha, laugh trip!)\n5.29 Smoke fills the room, and I leave it: why think it any great matter?\nBook 6 #6.6 \u0026ldquo;The best way to avenge yourself is not to become as they are.\u0026rdquo;\n6.11 Great advice for building habits: \u0026ldquo;Never miss twice. Return to your equilibrium immediately.\u0026rdquo;\n6.12 Outer work vs. Inner work\n6.13 \u0026ldquo;So follow this practice throughout your life, and where things seem most worthy of your approval, lay them naked, and see how cheap they are, and strip them of the pretences of which they are so vain.\u0026rdquo;\n6.15 Change renews.\n6.18 Legacy is useless.\n6.19 If others can do it, so can you.\n6.21 The pursuit of truth requires that you are willing to change your mind.\n6.22 Focus on your own duty.\n6.27 Even bad behavior is useful because it satisfies a particular need. Anger against bad behavior is not the best response—truthful correction is.\n6.28 Death is a rest from our impulses.\n6.47 In this world, there is only one thing of real value, to pass our days in truth and justice, and yet be gracious to those who are false and unjust.\n6.49 Be contented with the time given to you in this world.\n6.53 \u0026ldquo;Acquire the habit of attending carefully to what is being said by another; and of entering, so far as possible, into the mind of the speaker.\u0026rdquo;\nBook 7 #7.7 Don\u0026rsquo;t be ashamed of receiving help.\n7.8 Don\u0026rsquo;t let the future trouble your mind.\n7.18 Do not be afraid of change.\n7.21 Close is the time when you will forget all things; and close, too, the time when all will forget you.\n7.27 Be grateful for what you have. But not too much you can\u0026rsquo;t let go when they\u0026rsquo;re gone.\n7.28 Your mind can be a source of serenity, a place of rest.\n7.34 Famous people are easily replaced by new famous people.\n7.46 How can you live your best life possible in the time granted to you?\n7.58 \u0026ldquo;Only pay attention, and resolve to act rightly in your own eyes in all that you do.\u0026rdquo;\n7.59 \u0026ldquo;Dig within; for within you lies the fountain of good, and it can always be gushing forth if only you always dig.\u0026rdquo;\n7.61 Life is not a dance. It is a wrestling match.\n7.63 People don\u0026rsquo;t intentionally become ignorant. If you remember this, you\u0026rsquo;ll be more empathetic.\n7.64 Happiness in life depends on very few conditions.\n7.68 You can preserve peace of mind even in the middle of chaos.\n7.69 \u0026ldquo;Perfection of character requires this, that you should live each days as though it were your last, and be neither agitated, nor lethargic, nor act a part.\u0026rdquo;\n7.70 It is impossible to escape from the wickedness of others. It\u0026rsquo;s very possible to escape from yours.\n7.74 Do not be tired of receiving benefits!\nBook 8 #8.16 Changing your mind to follow someone else\u0026rsquo;s advice is still a free action—you acted, not someone else.\n8.27 You have three relationships: (1) your relationship to yourself, (2) your relationship to God/Universe, and (3) your relationship with others.\n8.28 Nothing painful comes from the outside. Pain is an internal judgment of a value-free phenomenon coming from the outside. The mind constructs pain and suffering. (Very Buddhist.)\n8.32 You must fashion your life one action at a time, and if each attains its own end as far as it can, be satisfied with that.\n8.33 \u0026ldquo;Accept without arrogance, relinquish without a struggle.\u0026rdquo;\n8.36 Great therapeutic advice on dealing with problems. His advice: Let go of the past and future. Focus on the present. Interestingly, this advice sounds a lot like mindfulness.\n8.44 \u0026ldquo;See that you award this present time to yourself.\u0026rdquo;\n8.46 The universe doesn\u0026rsquo;t give you something you can\u0026rsquo;t endure.\n8.48 The mind is a refuge.\n8.49 \u0026ldquo;Always keep to first impressions.\u0026rdquo;\n8.51 Independence + kindness + singularity + reverence = a resilient and temperate mind or life\n8.52 To understand yourself, understand the Universe. Physics and metaphysics is important in learning how to live.\n8.54 Thinking and learning should be like breathing—you observe what is arround you then you share it everywhere.\n8.56 Each individual has a mind of his own.\n8.60 The mind is like an arrow—sharp and accurate in hitting its mark.\nBook 9 #9.11 If you can\u0026rsquo;t change people, then just be kind to them. Kindness is useful when you can no longer change people.\n9.15 There is no value in the physical world. Value judgments are created by the mind.\n9.21 Each change is a death. Death is just change, not something to be afraid of.\n9.29 Do what you have to do even if nobody notices. Be satisfied to make even the smallest advance. \u0026ldquo;The work of philosophy is simple and modest; do not seduce me into vain ostentation.\u0026rdquo;\n9.30 Neither remembrance nor fame nor anything else whatever is worth a passing thought.\nBook 10 #10.16 Stop the talking. Just do it.\n10.24 Great questions to ask about how one uses one\u0026rsquo;s mind.\n10.35 A healthy mind should be ready for everything that could come about.\nBook 11 #11.5 What is your profession? To be a good person.\n11.9 It is possible to continue living according to your beliefs and being gentle toward those who oppose your beliefs.\n11.15 \u0026ldquo;In short, a good and honest person should resemble one who smells like a goat in this respect, that anyone who comes near him is immediately aware of it whether he wishe it or not.\u0026rdquo; (Haha)\n11.18 When annoyed and loosing patience, remember: you could die any time.\n11.19 It is not the actions of others that trouble us. It is our interpretation/judgment/reaction to their actions that trouble us. Fix your interpretation and you will fix your trouble. Your anger towards a behavior will bring you more suffering than the behavior itself.\n11.29 You cannot be an artist of life if you haven\u0026rsquo;t lived yet.\nBook 12 # 12.1 All those things which you hope to attain by a circuitous route, you can secure at this moment, if you do not deny them to yourself.\n12.4 \u0026ldquo;So much greater is our respect for what our neighbors think of us than what we think of ourselves!\n12.6 \u0026ldquo;Practice even at the things that you have lost all hope of achieving.\u0026rdquo;\n12.17 \u0026ldquo;If something is not right, do not do it, if something is not true, do not say it; for you should keep your impulses under your own control.\u0026rdquo;\n12.21 \u0026ldquo;In no great while you will be no one and nowhere, and nothing that you now behold will be in existence, nor will anyone now alive. For it is in the nature of all things to change and alter and perish, so that others may rise in their turn.\u0026rdquo;\n12.23 One\u0026rsquo;s death is not bad. It is good and beneficial because it is according to the law of the universe.\n12.26 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the life of every one of us is confined to the present moment and this is all that we have.\u0026rdquo;\n12.27 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the pride that prides itself on its freedom from pride is the most objectionable pride of all.\u0026rdquo;\n12.29 Our security in life is to see each things as it is in its full nature, in both its material and its causal aspect; and to do what is right and speak what is true with all our heart. What remains but to enjoy one\u0026rsquo;s life, linking one good act to another, so that not even the smallest space is ever left between?\n12.32 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;imagine nothing to be of any great moment apart from this, that you should act as your own nature directs, and endure whatever universal nature brings.\u0026rdquo;\n12.33 Everything rests on how you use your mind.\n","date":"1 May 2020","permalink":"/essays/meditations-by-marcus-aurelius/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (Book Summary)"},{"content":"I sat at the farthest seat at the back of the Anfra. The one near the lock of the backdoor. I like this position. It allows me to stretch my legs on the long bench-like seats of the Anfra while I look out the window. My sister sat on the other side, parallel to me, doing the same thing: stretching out her legs and looking out the window. I opened my window as wide as it can and felt the cold breeze blow strong on my face as the vehicle started moving. I felt good.\nBy the time we reached the beach, the sun is about to set. Probably, about twenty minutes before it\u0026rsquo;s gone. I walked towards the little waves and let them tickle the tiny spaces between my toes as the sand beneath my feet slowly gushed back to the ocean. The breeze is colder and stronger here than on the road, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel as consoling. What feels really consoling is the water. Not the tickle of the waves but just the presence of water. Perhaps, even the sound of it.\nI felt good.\nAfter a long time, I felt really good.\nThere was a time in my life when I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel anything—not sadness or happiness, nothing.\nThis is what depression and the drugs that attempt to cure it do—they numb that part of you that feels. Depression is not sadness. It is the absence of sadness—and all other emotions.\nAs my brain slowly healed, I started noticing how little things and actions generate feel-good experiences. These are things and actions I used to overlook—things like the cold breeze or the presence of flowing water. Today, exposing myself to these things and taking tiny actions that immediately make me feel good form a large part of what I do every day.\nI realized that everything we want—our goals and aspirations—are desired not for themselves but for the feelings that they generate. We work not for money and not even for what money could buy but for the feelings and experiences that are generated by what money could buy. We don\u0026rsquo;t realize this often but what we really desire in life is to feel good.\nWorse, what we don\u0026rsquo;t often realize is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a lot of work, time, or money to actually feel good. Of course, taking care of our finances, finding work we love, or taking time to nurture good relationships all create external situations where good feelings are easier to generate. However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that we need to wait long or work hard just to feel what we want to feel.\nThere are simple, tiny actions we can do to feel good now—tiny actions like spending time in nature where air and water could console us. These are actions that help us access our emotions directly thus generating our desired states of mind immediately. If feeling good is the ultimate goal, then perhaps these shortcuts to feeling good should always be our priority.\nThis is ultimately the reason why I will always be a fan of self-care practices like meditation, yoga, journaling, proper nutrition, sleep, being in nature, and exercise. All of these generate good feelings almost immediately after they\u0026rsquo;re performed. There is no need to wait years to experience happiness or Ginhawa (the indigenous Filipino concept that captures integral well-being). These feelings are just one breath, one asana, one journal page, one nutritious meal, one good night sleep, one walk at the beach, or one workout away.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s more, establishing a strong foundation of tiny feel-good practices prepares us to tackle the larger, more complex projects that we need to take on. And if a big tragedy occurs—which always does—we\u0026rsquo;re better prepared for them.\nPractices that let us access Ginhawa directly makes us more capable and resilient individuals.\n","date":"2 March 2020","permalink":"/essays/accessing-ginhawa-directly/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Accessing Ginhawa Directly"},{"content":"Better late than never.\nWriting my annual review is one of the highlights of my year and I was looking forward to finally write and publish mine. However, my New Year started differently from what I expected as I was forced to deal with a health issue almost as challenging as my depressive episode in 2011. This meant postponing my writing and publishing of my annual review of 2019.\nI feel very fortunate and grateful to be in a position where I am able to actually finish something to share with you today despite everything I\u0026rsquo;m going through right now.\nLike I did the previous two years, I reviewed the three main areas of my life in 2019 (health, sustenance, and meaning) using these three questions:\nWhat went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What am I working toward? I also answered a fourth question: What did I learn this year?\nAll these questions were from James Clear. I hope you find something useful in my personal journey in 2019.\n1. What went well this year? #Health #I was able to sustain an intermittent fasting regimen for the entire year and I have achieved results. I no longer eat breakfast, and I only eat by 11:00 AM. This freed my mornings from the drowsiness I usually get from a full stomach. It also gave me some extra time to do sustenance and creative work. I no longer have the feeling of overfeeding myself, but I don\u0026rsquo;t feel deprived as well. Fortunately, I was also able to lose some weight and other people started noticing.\nMy regimen is not yet ideal. I still want to push my first meal to 12:00 NN and eat only until 8:00 PM. In fact, I started at 10:00 AM then 10:30 AM, slowly so that my brain (and stomach) do not resist. This is something I learned from James Clear and his book Atomic Habits. I am after establishing the habit first. I\u0026rsquo;ll optimize later, which in this case involves moving my first meal to 12:00 NN and eventually cutting my servings or portions. This is, by far, my biggest health achievement this year, and I\u0026rsquo;m proud of it.\nSustenance #I continued working as a freelance editor this year. My earnings took a massive hit when a major source of book editing projects changed its business model and no longer brought consistent work. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the realities that freelancers have to face. Fortunately, I have prepared for times like these and have enough savings to support me for an entire year.\nAfter receiving word from this source, I immediately started looking for alternative sources of projects. I found Michael LaRocca, a veteran freelance editor who wrote a book about how he started freelance editing. His advice was really helpful in my search for alternative sources of income as a freelance editor.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take long before I found a new source of editing projects. With the help of three references, I went through the application process and was surprised to know that my editing skills were actually good enough to get me in! I\u0026rsquo;ve been editing for more than two years now but I still doubted my editing skills sometimes (if not most of the time). So, getting a place in this elite pool of freelance editors was a testament to the hard work I\u0026rsquo;ve put into editing.\nThe new source was actually more ideal than the previous because it offered shorter assignments with higher rates of return. Plus, it was very, very flexible, something I always need in my creative spontaneous life. I am very grateful for the three people who wrote letters of recommendation for me. Without them, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get in the pool.\nAs a creative, I use the Einstein/Day Job model. My art is my career. My work as a freelance editor is just there to pay the bills and support me financially as I do my art.\nMeaning #The biggest highlight of my year in this area is expanding and maintaining a creative routine in the morning.\nI work in the afternoons, sometimes, extending my working hours up until the evenings when I have a deadline. I don\u0026rsquo;t have weekends as I also work during those days. Because my mornings are free and my mind is usually sharp due to intermittent fasting, I use my mornings to explore my various artistic pursuits and creative interests. I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing more about my current morning routine in a future post but, for now, I\u0026rsquo;ll mention that my morning creative routine usually involves the following:\nReading at least two poems Reading all the entries for that day in Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s journal Reading a page, a section, or an entire chapter of a book Writing in my diary for at least five minutes Translating one chapter of the Tao Te Ching to Pangasinan Doing one drawing exercise (I\u0026rsquo;m exploring Lynda Barry\u0026rsquo;s exercises but also draw my own poetry comics. Sometimes, if I still have time, I would post an article on the blog and send it to my newsletter subscribers.\nStarting and maintaining this routine was easy because I already have a morning routine established, which means I just have to stack each creative activity over another.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s also worth mentioning here that I was granted a fellowship at the University of the Philippines Institute of Creative Writing\u0026rsquo;s (UP ICW) Saling Panitik: Ikalawang Bienvenido Lumbera Seminar-Palihan sa Pagsasalin, a seminar-workshop in translation. This was one of the highlights of my creative journey this year and the experience and learning were really amazing.\n2. What didn\u0026rsquo;t go well this year? #Health #My biggest setback in 2019 was getting an ear infection in September. It only affected my left ear so one of the doctors I later consulted said that I may have injured my eardrum with a cotton bud when I was cleaning my ear. I clean my ear every evening after I take a shower and I do insert the cotton bud until the ear drum so I may definitely have done this. I know now that this was very dangerous and very wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s probably one of the littlest things I did, which I will forever regret. I could\u0026rsquo;ve spared myself a lot of pain, frustration, and money if I only knew this. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t my teachers and parents tell me about this?\nI failed (or maybe the doctors too?) in managing the infection and it returned; this time, it was really bad that my doctor had to prescribe a really potent ear drop antibiotic, which was a little painful when applied. The infection was finally cured by December (almost four months of an ear infection!), but it left me with a large hole in my eardrum; so large that it was almost only the sidelining left.\nI should probably be grateful that the infection did not destroy any nerve or bones in the ear. Nevertheless, the experience was still really bad and it was my first experience of having hearing loss. My hearing test (audiometry) revealed that while my inner ear was still strong and unaffected, I suffered mild to moderate hearing loss on my left ear. Communication became a little bit difficult in the following months. The biggest setback from all these, however, was:\nbeing told that my eardrum won\u0026rsquo;t be able to close itself and developing tinnitus, a constant ringing in my left ear. The first problem caused me a lot of anxiety. The surgery required to close my perforated eardrum (tympanoplasty) will cost me Php 90,000. While some opt not to get their eardrum surgically closed, this puts them into the risk of recurring ear infections, which could lead to other worse ear problems. I am currently working with a new doctor who suggested (finally) to take an observation period to assess whether or not my eardrum could still fix itself. My eardrum healing itself will really be ideal.\nThe second problem caused by my ear infection and a perforated eardrum was developing tinnitus, a constant 24/7 high-pitched sound in my left ear. This is currently my biggest life challenge and I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing a separate post about it in the near future.\nSustenance #My earnings as a freelance editor declined in the early second half of 2019. I continued to write podcast show notes to cover the deficit, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough. The book editing company that used to send me book editing assignments changed its business model and it no longer offered a la carte book editing, which meant that this source of income was completely lost. Luckily, I have an emergency fund in place, which helped me go through down months, and by November, I was able to find a new source of consistent editing projects, which was more ideal than the one I lost.\nMeaning #When I wrote my Annual Review last year, I mentioned that I wanted to travel more in 2019. I wanted to go on a solo adventure and maybe travel like I used to do. I failed terribly in this intention. I haven\u0026rsquo;t gone on any solo trip since 2018, and I only had a few trips this year: one in Laguna and another in Cebu.\nI\u0026rsquo;m slowly getting comfortable with the reality that I\u0026rsquo;m probably more of an indoor rather than an outdoor person. There are so many things I want to read, write, and think about inside my head that the only regular outdoor activity I am able to sustain is my afternoon bike ride and walk, which fuel my indoor projects as well. Nevertheless, I will continue to set this intention of seeing the world more this year, especially Nature, and this is despite the fact that I am dealing with a health problem right now.\n3. What am I working towards? #Health #Health will be a big theme for me this year. It has already been a big theme for the first 19 days of 2020 and there are no signs of this being not the case. I am both scared and optimistic and will need all the support I can get as I go through another health challenge.\nI have started improving my sleep in the past few days of 2020 and will continue to do so, with exercise aiding me in this goal. I find that when I sleep well the previous night, I am better able to deal with my tinnitus and react to it better. I also intend to strengthen my relationships with people and communities, which are so important when facing immense challenges. Specifically, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about spending more time with my friends in Manila and Baguio as well as revisiting the HEAL farm this year.\nSustenance #My main intention this year in this area of my life is to get really, really good at editing. This means getting good at grammar and the ins and outs of the trade. Editing is my main source of income and it does not rob me of the energy I use in my personal creative projects, which involve a lot of writing. It\u0026rsquo;s only reasonable that I give it the attention it deserves and be the best editor I can be.\nMeaning #I intend to do a lot more drawing this year. Drawing is a passion I want to do a lot when I was a child. I learned to draw even before I started reading or writing. In grade school, I would admire classmates who were very good at drawing anime. I tried drawing anime myself and before long, some classmates would pay me to draw for them. Later, I created my own characters, bought composition notebooks, divided them in panels, and drew comics spontaneously. Sadly, none of those composition notebooks survived, although I can still remember some of the characters and scenes I drew back then.\nAs I grew up, I got deeper into writing and got out of touch with drawing. I did try cartooning for my high school newspaper and drawing illustrations for the Deaf when I was a pastor in college, but that was that. No animes, no elaborate stories, no comics.\nBy the end of 2019, I finally got the chance to relearn how to draw. My biggest motivator in this decision was Austin Kleon and my distant mentor is Lynda Barry, a Filipino-Norwegian artist whose philosophy of drawing aligns much with my general life philosophy—let go of the rules, just do it!\nIf you are curious to see some of my drawings, click here.\nI intend to continue drawing in 2020 and mishmash this with the other crafts I\u0026rsquo;m exploring like storytelling, poetry, fantasy, etc.\nBonus Question: What did I learn this year? #To end my annual review, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing with you five important lessons I learned in 2019.\n\u0026ldquo;Health is essentially the same as life. The end of life is the end of health.\u0026rdquo; This is a quote from my favorite philosopher Steve Patterson. This is perhaps my biggest lesson in 2019. It\u0026rsquo;s actually the biggest lesson of my entire life since 2011! For some reason, I need to continuously relearn it. When life is really good, we get too hung up in tweaking things like productivity, income, even creativity, when none of that really matters if we\u0026rsquo;re sick or disabled. At the end of the day, health is the most important determinant of our overall happiness. If we could dedicate our time and attention to only one thing, it should be health. No questions asked.\nActions that are repeated and that turn into habits are the compound interest of life. This is a lesson I learned from Atomic Habits but it is a lesson I needed to apply to fully understand. In 2019, I dedicated a lot of time to my creative routines in the morning, afternoon, and evening. These routines led to a lot of poems, journal entries, and philosophical realizations. I consider these routines my biggest achievements in 2019.\nHearing is more important than we usually assume. Getting an ear infection and developing tinnitus has a very, very large impact on my current life. If I learned to value my hearing earlier, I could\u0026rsquo;ve prevented a lot of suffering I experienced in recent weeks. If you use cotton buds to clean your ears, stop! If you\u0026rsquo;re fond of loud music, stop! Protect your ears before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\nDrawing can be relearned. This is another lesson I need to learn by \u0026ldquo;doing\u0026rdquo;. I dreamt and theorized a lot about how I\u0026rsquo;ll go about relearning this lost passion of mine. But until I bought a nice pen and some twistable crayons and started drawing, I never really believed that I could draw again.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll find love if we wait, we give it a chance, and we remember our own frailties. Since going through a breakup in 2018, I started building my life back to the point where I was confident to go back to dating again. After failing twice, I finally found someone with whom I have strong chemistry. We were both avid diarists, we love introspection, and we\u0026rsquo;re both interested in bettering ourselves. Despite this, we also came from very different backgrounds and possessed contrasting personality traits. I could say that I am currently at a place where I\u0026rsquo;m in a relationship with someone who is a source of encouragement during this tough time in my life and of inspiration to not stop dreaming and flourishing whatever the odds. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this would have been possible if I didn\u0026rsquo;t learn to wait for the right person, to practice compassion, and to develop the willingness to accept the frailties of others remembering that I myself have my own frailties.\n","date":"21 January 2020","permalink":"/essays/2019-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2019 Annual Review"},{"content":"It was a great reading year for me. I started tracking my reading this year after seeing this page from Frank Chimero. I also tried remembering the books I read since 2015. My list is incomplete because I forgot a lot of books I read, but it\u0026rsquo;s near accurate, and it clearly shows I read more books this 2019 than any other year that came before it. James Clear was right: what gets tracked, gets improved.\nAll-in-all, I read 18 books. I know it\u0026rsquo;s far from the lists of the likes of Austin Kleon (who reads 100+ books a year!), but I am proud of what I accomplished with my reading habit this year. I don\u0026rsquo;t really consider myself a fast reader, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think I want to be one. When I love a book, especially when it\u0026rsquo;s highly practical, I write a summary of it, which involves going back to each chapter of the book and really analyzing its main points. I remember the book easier that way, and I enjoy the process very much.\nThis post features the best books I read this year, including the main reasons why I love them so much. The list is arranged in descending order, starting with my most favorite of the year.\nHenry David Thoreau: A Life | Laura Dassow Walls #Laura Dassow Wall\u0026rsquo;s biography of one of the most eclectic writers of all time was my best read of the year. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the books that are just so immersive. I have an eye for biographies because I was exposed to them in college. I know what good historiography is. But Dassow Walls\u0026rsquo; biography was entirely different and unique from all the academic biographies I\u0026rsquo;ve read. She writes as if she\u0026rsquo;s in a quest to answer the same questions that Thoreau asked himself—and, actually, she was! She also writes poetically and she has a taste for creative literary tools—there are cliffhangers all over the book creating suspense at the end of sections, making you want to read more of what could\u0026rsquo;ve been a very boring book.\nI felt very, very close to Thoreau while reading this biography. I read it in the morning, then I read it in the evening, and every time I read it, I was spending time with a great master of the art of living. My creative life will never be the same. In Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s life, I found an affirmation of the things that I have already been doing in my relationship with the material world and my relationship with my art. Thoreau also provides a model for me to follow.\nMy favorite part of the book was Laura\u0026rsquo;s description of Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s final moments. I can still picture in my mind how the dying Thoreau lied down on his porch while passersby—both young and old, even children—came by to pay their respects to a nation\u0026rsquo;s treasure who is about to breathe his last. It was just powerful writing. I\u0026rsquo;m currently immersing myself in Thoreau\u0026rsquo;s journal, reading his entries for each day. If I keep at it, I\u0026rsquo;ll finish by December next year and his journal will definitely be part of next year\u0026rsquo;s My Hero Books list.\nBird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life | Anne Lamott #This book was probably my first introduction to humorous writing in English. I really liked this style of writing a lot that I\u0026rsquo;ve begun reading Billy Collins\u0026rsquo; collection of poems Sailing Alone in the Room. I\u0026rsquo;m experimenting with my comedic voice both in my poetry and in recent explorations in drawings. Reading the book made me nostalgic about writers like Bob Ong and Eros Atalia—Filipino humor writers whose books I read in grade school and high school.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s most interesting about Anne Lamott\u0026rsquo;s book is that it was also a book of writing lessons. So, Anne was basically teaching writing but through a comedic voice. It was very effective! If only teachers of all kinds could teach with fun and humor, things will be a lot easier for everyone—students, parents, taxpayers, politicians, even the teachers themselves!\nMy favorite lesson from Anne was her advice on how to avoid libel when writing about your ex:\nIf you disguise this person carefully so that he cannot be recognized by the physical or professional facts of his life, you can use him in your work. And the best advice I can give you is to give him a teenie little penis so he will be less likely to come forth.\nHaha. Great advice from a great book! I highly recommend Anne\u0026rsquo;s book.\nUltralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career | Scott H. Young #Ultralearning by Scott H. Young sits right beside James Clear\u0026rsquo;s Atomic Habits on the shelf of the most practical and actionable books I\u0026rsquo;ve read. James is a better writer than Scott (and Scott knows this), but his book was something I consulted many times throughout the year. His chapter on meta-learning was most useful to me. Although I\u0026rsquo;m also experimenting with spontaneous learning like what I\u0026rsquo;m currently doing with studying how to draw, Scott\u0026rsquo;s meta-learning process was so useful in identifying the best learning paths to follow in several learning projects I did this year. Another piece of advice from the book which I have already internalized a lot in my life is the principle of directness. I didn\u0026rsquo;t read a book on how to write poetry, I just wrote poetry. I didn\u0026rsquo;t read a book on drawing, I just drew. I didn\u0026rsquo;t use to do this. I would waste a lot of time planning for certain learning projects before engaging with the exact skills, tasks, and actions those projects involves. Today—and I owe some of this from Scott\u0026rsquo;s book—I tend to dive immediately to an activity I want to do, and I am more comfortable with this.\nDevotions: The Selected Poems of Mary Oliver | Mary Oliver** #This is only the second poetry collection book I finished reading. The first collection was the Alon poetry collection What the Water Said. Ever since I started writing poems, I also started reading 1-2 poems every morning. I started this poetry reading habit through Mary Oliver\u0026rsquo;s Devotions.\nDevotions was Mary Oliver\u0026rsquo;s last book. It is a collection of her best poems which she handpicked herself. This collection inspired me to go out in nature more and write poems while there. I also copied the styles of some of her poems in a few poems of mine, like this one. The book also made me feel closer to one of the human beings I really admire for just the way she lived. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to read a biography of Mary Oliver one day.\nBelong: Find Your People, Create Community, and Live a More Connected Life | Radha Agrawal #Community, friendship, and relationship are subjects that fascinate me a lot—partly because I think I\u0026rsquo;m not that good at them and partly because I\u0026rsquo;m so bothered that too many people are not good at them and seem to be okay with that. They have their phones and social media, anyway.\nEarly this year, I scoured the Internet for book recommendations on community-building. I decided to pick Radha\u0026rsquo;s book and invest time in it because of its systematic but not boring approach to community-building.\nThe book was also filled with a lot of doodles and drawings, which I really love. Interestingly, Radha\u0026rsquo;s book was the same publisher who publishes Austin Kleon\u0026rsquo;s drawing-filled books, Workman Publishing. Drawings just make learning so much easier.\nRadha\u0026rsquo;s philosophy of community-building is bullet-proof: 1) Start with yourself. Get to know who you really are and what you really want. 2) Find people who share your values and build your community around them. Without inner work, building a community you actually love is impossible.\nOther Great Reads # The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. A bit overrated. Steven\u0026rsquo;s advice can be contradictory sometimes. Plus, the woo-woo element is just too much for my taste. Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. Another overrated book. Or maybe I just read a bad translation by Robin Hard. In general, the book is just too old for our times and will only inspire those who already adhere to stoic ideas. Nevertheless, there definitely are gems of wisdom scattered around the book (and some funny metaphors too!). Influence by Robert Cialdini. I listened to this as an audiobook. Enlightening but a bit overrated (again). The main points can be summarized in one page or even a single paragraph. The stories are fun though and they could help you remember the main points better. The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ DeMarco. I read this after feeling my entrepreneurial itch late this year. Although I do not agree with a lot of MJ\u0026rsquo;s views, I still think it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most honest entrepreneurship books around and, therefore, every aspiring entrepreneur must read it. Beyond Morality by Richard Garner. I included this in my hero books last year but I actually finished reading it this year. One of my favorite books of all time. Ignore Everybody by Hugh MacLeod. Hugh\u0026rsquo;s advice can also be contradictory but his story is a gem. Every aspiring artist and creative must read Hugh\u0026rsquo;s book. Company of One by Paul Jarvis. I love Paul\u0026rsquo;s work and I listened to his new book late this year. While Paul\u0026rsquo;s views are really thought-provoking, unique, and brave, I find his book less practical than other business books. He has a course though that accompanies the book. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;ll learn the specifics. The Art of Fully Living by Tal Gur. Great kick of inspiration. Tal\u0026rsquo;s story proves that the path to self-improvement can still (and must!) continue even when very challenging situations come our way. Keep Going by Austin Kleon. Austin\u0026rsquo;s last book in his trilogy could\u0026rsquo;ve easily made it to my top five list if only it was as memorable as the other two books. The book just didn\u0026rsquo;t have the same punch I felt after reading the first two. Nevertheless, I believe Austin\u0026rsquo;s best work is in his blog anyway, and I\u0026rsquo;m an avid reader of everything he puts out in his blog. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. The first novel I\u0026rsquo;ve read after many years. Tolkien is not very versed in literary techniques but his world-building is genius! I started reading his biography earlier this year (but stopped) and watched the movie version of the book. The Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin. While not as comprehensive and practical as Ultralearning, Josh Waitzkin\u0026rsquo;s life and processes were influential in how I currently view learning, specifically how it transfers across different areas of life. The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Reading a classic and reading it fast was a great confidence booster in my reading habit early this year. I enjoyed the humor, the drawings, and the subtle lessons sprinkled around every sentence of this book. Night by Elie Wiesel. A very gloomy book. I won\u0026rsquo;t be reading Holocaust books for a while. That\u0026rsquo;s it! That\u0026rsquo;s my reading year this year. I have great books lined up for 2020 and I have begun reading some of them. I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to another book-filled year.\n","date":"28 December 2019","permalink":"/essays/my-hero-books-of-2019/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My Hero Books of 2019"},{"content":" There is joy in self-forgetfulness. So I try to make the light in others\u0026rsquo; eyes my sun, the music in others\u0026rsquo; ears my symphony, the smile on others\u0026rsquo; lips my happiness.\n- Helen Keller\nHelen Keller was born deaf and blind. Her condition forced her to think about herself most of the time. It took longer for her to accomplish things that most people do pretty fast—like reading. She spent more time taking care of herself and nurturing her own growth. And this is why she became the great Helen Keller—the most educated deaf and blind girl in her time.\nBecause she had to work hard for her education, she was left in the comforts of herself most of the time. In her autobiography, she admitted that books, rather than people, were her constant companion. They were like a little \u0026ldquo;society\u0026rdquo; of hers.\nThis is typical for people with disabilities, chronic illnesses, or other afflictions. They tend to focus on themselves a lot. I noticed this on others when I was a sign language interpreter with the Deaf and also on myself when I was recovering from depression. But this tendency to be self-absorbed when under such circumstances should be understandable. How and why would people with disabilities and chronic illnesses think of other people first when they have their very own \u0026ldquo;unfair\u0026rdquo; share of obstacles?\nInterestingly, Helen Keller\u0026rsquo;s story later in her life sheds a different light on this question. While she spent most of her time alone with her books as a child, she started to see the beauty in thinking about other people as she got older, as the quote which began this essay suggests. Her care for others even went as far as her adopting a radical communist political ideology later in her life.\nHelen Keller\u0026rsquo;s story suggests that while disability or life issues will keep us from thinking about others, we are so hardwired to be social beings that it is so difficult to escape this desire to help others, be part of a community, and contribute to the growth of people we care about.\nAll of us are born to connect, hardwired to live in the company of those who know and love us. When we draw from deep wells of social support—the care and concern of close friends, family, and community—we’re more resilient to the slings and arrows of fortune, and we’re considerably less vulnerable to depression. Social connection helps push the brain in an antidepressant direction, turning down activity in stress circuitry, and boosting the activity of feel-good brain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin. That’s why it makes sense to swim hard against the tide of our “culture of isolation” and to place our relationships at the very top of the priority list. Truly, nothing in life matters more.\n- Stephen S. Ilardi\nThere is happiness in forgetting about ourselves and giving our attention to someone in need of it.\nBut which of these two provides the most happiness?\nI propose that there is no one answer to this question but rather a myriad of possible answers. Happiness is subjective as it is unquantifiable by standard measurements.\nI can only speak for myself, and what I would say is that we will be more fulfilled if we find the convergence between our personal desires and that of the others. Thinking about ourselves can help us find direction in a rather directionless life while thinking about others and serving them can provide meaning in a rather meaningless existence.\nDoes this mean that both thinking about oneself and thinking about other people serve the egotistic desire of self-actualization? Not really. This is simply the fact of life.\nWe give and the universe is generous enough to give back. Not because it knows we want something in return but simply because people resonate with the kindness in us, and like us, most people are filled with more positive emotions than we might expect.\nThere is happiness in self-forgetfulness because it stops the mind from thinking about questions that will take decades to answer: Who am I? What am I here for?\nSelf-forgetfulness shifts our focus from endless thoughts we could ponder about to concrete actions we could take—actions that, hopefully, touch the lives of so many others who are waiting for what we can offer.\n","date":"29 November 2019","permalink":"/essays/self-forgetfulness/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"The Happiness in Self-Forgetfulness"},{"content":"At the end of any year, I come up with an Annual Review.

Their main thesis is this: identify the most important thing (\u0026ldquo;the ONE THING\u0026rdquo;) in your life in general and in every specific area of your life and put your best efforts into that.\nChapter One: The One Thing #Main point: What\u0026rsquo;s the ONE THING you can do this week such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?\nChapter Two: The Domino Effect #Main point: Extraordinary success is built sequentially, one thing at a time, not simultaneously.\nDo the following every day:\nEvery day, line up your priorities anew. Find your most important domino. Whack away at it until it falls. Chapter Three: Success Leaves Clues #Main point: While you may have many passions and skills, what is that one passion or skill that gives you an intense emotion, that defines you, or drives you more than anything else? Focus on that.\nPart 1: The Lies #6 Lies\nEverything matters equally Multitasking A disciplined life Willpower is always on will-call A balanced life Big is bad Chapter Four: Everything Matters Equally #Main point: Prioritize your most important tasks every day and every time you need to do so.\nInstead of a To-Do List, use a Success List—a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results. Extraordinary results are disproportionately created by fewer actions than most realize. Extreme Pareto\nStart with a large list. Whittle your way from there to the critical few. Do not stop until you end with the essential ONE. Chapter Five: Multitasking #Main point: When doing your most important work, don\u0026rsquo;t multitask.\nThe costs of juggling:\nIt takes some time to start a new task. It takes some time to restart a task you quit. There’s no guarantee that you’ll ever pick up exactly where you left off. Chapter Six: A Disciplined Life #Main point: Discipline is just a habit. Choose a habit and establish it with a little discipline until it gets easier.\nHow to form habits\nChoose one habit. Stick to it long enough to be a habit. Watch how it becomes easier. Do the most important thing and all others become easier. Build on the newly established habit or build another one. Chapter Seven: Willpower is Always on Will-Call #Main point: Do your most important tasks at the time of the day when your willpower is high.\nHow to manage willpower\nReserve it for the things that matter most. Replenish it when it\u0026rsquo;s low. Eat right and regularly. Chapter Eight: A Balanced Life #Main point: Be clear about your priority at work so you can get it done. Then be clear about your priorities in other areas of your life so you can get them done and go back to work.\nExtraordinary results require focused attention and time. Time on one thing means time away from another. Magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes. Instead of balancing, use counterbalancing How to counterbalance your work and life\nAccept that you will have to spend more time at one to achieve extraordinary results. But don\u0026rsquo;t spend too much time on one that there is nothing waiting for you on the other when you return. Separate your work life and personal life into two distinct buckets. Then within each bucket, also use counterbalancing to manage various goals and responsibilities. Chapter Nine: Big is Bad #Main point: Thinking big is good because it frees you to ask different questions, follow different paths, and try new things.\nThe only actions that become springboards to succeeding big are those informedly big thinking to begin with. Think as big as you possibly can and base what you do, how you do it, and who you do it with on succeeding at that level. As we approach Big, we realize that things are easier than we imagine. The journey to achieving big makes you bigger. Part Two: The Truth # The key to success isn’t in all the things we do but in the handful of things we do well. Success comes down to this: being appropriate in the moments of your life. Success is being able to say: \u0026ldquo;This is where I’m meant to be right now, doing exactly what I’m doing.\u0026rdquo; Chapter Ten: The Focusing Question #Main point: \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the ONE THING I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?\u0026rdquo; This is the focusing question. Use it all the time**.**\nThe first step is important, and the focusing question helps keep the first step from being a misstep. The focusing question is both a map for the big picture and a compass for the smallest next move. Using the focusing question, you’re setting yourself up to accomplish one task on top of another. Chapter Eleven: The Success Habit #Main point: Use the Focusing Question as a habit when starting your day and when finding what matters most in your life areas.\nContinue to ask the question until you can see the connection and all your dominoes are lined up. How to use the focusing question in your life areas\nArrange your life areas according to priority. Find what matters most in each area (the ONE THING) and focus on doing them. View them as the cornerstones that when done makes everything else easier. Reframe the question by inserting your area of focus. You can also include a time frame like “right now” or “this year” to give your answer the appropriate level of immediacy. You can also include a time frame like “in five years” or “someday” to find a big-picture answer that points you at outcomes to aim for. Say the category first, then state the question, add a time frame, and end by adding “such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary? Chapter Twelve: The Path to Great Answers #Main point: For extraordinary results, (1) ask a great question and (2) seek out a great answer.\nHow to ask a great question\nAsk a question that is big enough that it pushes you and stretches you. Ask a question that aims towards a specific answer. To make a big, specific question even more powerful, convert it to the focusing question. This forces you to identify what absolutely matters most and start there. How to find a great answer\nBenchmark. Uncover the best research and study the highest achievers. Search for clues and role models to point you in the right direction. Trend. Use your benchmark as your minimum, a launchpad to see what might come next in the same direction as the best performers or in an entirely new direction. Part Three: Extraordinary Results #The three elements in implementing the ONE THING\nPurpose Priority Productivity Use your purpose as a guiding force in determining the priority that drives your actions. The more productive people become the more purpose and priority push and drive them. Profit, the result of productivity, is also driven by purpose and priority. Chapter Thirteen: Live With Purpose #Main point: Who we are and where we want to go (purpose) determine what we do (priority) and what we accomplish (productivity).\nNo matter our motivations, most of what we do in life is ultimately meant to make us happy. Becoming more engaged in what we do by finding ways to make our life more meaningful is the surest way of finding lasting happiness. Know what matters to you then take daily doses of actions in alignment with it. To find your purpose, ask: \u0026ldquo;What’s the ONE THING I can do in my life that would mean the most to me and the world, such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?\u0026rdquo; Chapter Fourteen: Live By Priority #Main point: Set your present priority based on your future priority.\nPurpose without priority is powerless. Priority, not priorities. We have goals and plans for only one reason—to be appropriate in the moments of our lives that matter. Your priority in the now determines your present now and future now. How to do goal setting for the Now\nSet a future goal. Methodically drill down to what you should be doing right now. Rest your ONE THING right now to your ONE THING today. Rest your ONE THING today to your ONE THING this week. Rest your ONE THING this week to your ONE THING this month. Connect today to all your tomorrows. Write down your answers. Chapter Fifteen: Live for Productivity #Main point: Block time for your ONE THING. Then protect that time block.\nFor onetime ONE THING, block off the appropriate hours and days. For habits, block off the appropriate time every day. If your ONE THING creates disproportionate results, then give it disproportionate time. Put up a sheet of paper that said, “Until My ONE Thing Is Done—Everything Else Is A Distraction!” How to time block effectively\nTime block your time off (vacation). Time block your ONE THING. Time block your planning time. Time block your time off.\nSee yourself as working between vacations. Manage your work time around your downtime. Time block your ONE THING.\nDesign your days around your one thing. Block 4 hours a day (minimum, if you can do more, do it). Be a maker in the morning and a manager in the afternoon. Time block your planning time.\nReflect on where you are and where you want to go. Do this annually and weekly. Chapter Sixteen: The Three Commitments #Main point: Commit to (1) adopting the mindset of someone seeking mastery, (2) continually seeking the very best ways of doing things, and (3) doing everything you can to achieve your ONE THING.\nAdopt the mindset of someone seeking mastery.\nMastering the right thing will make everything else you do easier or no longer necessary. Give the best you have to become the best you can be at your most important work. Be a master of what you know, apprentice of what you don’t. Continually seek the very best ways of doing things.\nLook for new models and systems of doing things. Use the Focusing Question to narrow your choices down to the next thing you should do. Live the accountability cycle.\nAccountability is the most important of the three commitments. Look at outcomes as the information you can use to frame better actions to get better outcomes. Sharing your progress towards your goals with someone regularly makes you almost twice as effective. Chapter Seventeen: The Four Thieves #Main point: Avoid the Four Thieves.\nThe four thieves\nInability to say NO Fear of chaos Poor health habits The environment doesn’t support your goals Inability to say NO\nThe way to protect what you’ve said yes to and stay productive is to say no to anyone or anything that could derail you. When you say yes to something, it’s imperative that you understand what you’re saying no to. Practice the Three-Foot Rule: A request must be connected to my ONE Thing for me to consider it. If not, then I either say no to it or use any of the approaches I shared above to deflect it elsewhere. Fear of chaos\nAccept that when you focus on your ONE THING, chaos will accumulate around you. Don\u0026rsquo;t fight this. Trust that your work on your ONE THING will help you manage the chaos later on. Poor health habits\nHigh achievement and extraordinary results require big energy. The trick is learning how to get it and keep it. Focus on having an energized start to each day. Starting each day this way makes the rest of the day easier. The environment doesn’t support your goals\nEnvironment = who you see + what you experience every day The people surrounding you and the physical environment surrounding you must support your goals. Chapter Eighteen: The Journey #Main point: Live a life of no regrets by putting your ONE THING at the top of your mind and at the top of your schedule.\nAt any moment in time, there can be only ONE THING, and when that ONE THING is in line with your purpose and sits atop your priorities, it will be the most productive thing you can do. How to go small to get big\nSurvey your choices. Narrow your options. Line up your priorities. Do what matters most. Go small by finding your ONE THING.

I know most people don\u0026rsquo;t ask the question. But by not asking the question, they unknowingly (and dangerously) outsource their search for answers―to their parents, their teachers, or their religious leaders. This leads to \u0026ldquo;business as usual\u0026rdquo;―they live their lives according to what is handed to them by tradition or by what is socially acceptable.\nBut what is traditional and socially acceptable isn\u0026rsquo;t always the best way for us to live. We have our own personality and preferences. So why do we want to do what other people―who have their own personalities and preferences―are doing?\nSometimes (or, perhaps, oftentimes), the answer boils down to this: we\u0026rsquo;re just lazy to do the amount of work required for answering such important question and so we just take what\u0026rsquo;s ready-made, what\u0026rsquo;s handed down to us. Or worse, we\u0026rsquo;re afraid of the consequences of learning about our personal truths.\nThis is an entire problem of its own, one that requires its own space for processing. But for those who have decided that the question of \u0026ldquo;How to live?\u0026rdquo; is a question they are ready and are brave enough to tackle, read on.\nThe Core Process is Simple #At its core, the process I have discovered on how to answer \u0026ldquo;How to live?\u0026rdquo; is actually very, very simple. It just involves three questions. Answer the three questions and you are way ahead of other people in your search.\nThe three questions are:\nHow do I know what I know? What exists? Using my answers for #1 and #2, how should I act? This process is so simple and so natural that we do it all the time.\nFor example, when you saw a flower and you picked it up, you just acted according to your answers to the three questions above automatically, without even stopping to ask and reflect on your answers!\nHow do I know what I know? \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;I trust what I \u0026lsquo;see\u0026rsquo;.\u0026rdquo; What exists? \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;I see a flower. Therefore, a flower exists.\u0026rdquo; Using my answers for #1 and #2, how should I act? \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Knowing that a flower exists and seeing that I could pick it up, I pick it up.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s that simple.\nHow we decide to know what we know determines what we believe exists. And our knowledge about our knowledge and about what exists informs us about what we decide to do.\nHow a Simple Process Gets Complicated #This simple process only gets complicated when you start to entertain other important questions related to these three main questions.\nHow do I know what I know?\nAre my senses reliable? Does what I know ultimately come from a supernatural being? Is what I know objective? Or is it subjective? What exists?\nDoes God exists? Is their a soul? Using my answers for #1 and #2, how should I act?\nIs my action \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;? How do I know what is \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;wrong?\u0026rdquo; From these additional questions arise complex answers from where entire religions, philosophies, and ideologies were constructed. These belief systems usually have similar answers to questions #3. Many want love and peace. But where they differ (and, therefore, disagree), are their answers to questions #1 and #2.\nA Christian and an atheist may both believe that people should act nonviolently towards each other. In this case, they reached the same conclusion in answering question #3. However, the two have \u0026ldquo;mutually exclusive\u0026rdquo; reasons for desiring nonviolence. The Christian is motivated by his belief in the accuracy of the knowledge he gets from the Bible (question #1), which teaches the existence of a living God (question #2) who wants his creation to reflect that. On the other hand, the atheist believes only what he sees (question #1) and, therefore, acts kindly towards other people not because a supernatural being instructed him to do so but simply out of fellow feeling towards those that he sees (question #2).\nEverything Boils Down to the Three Questions #But no matter how complex a worldview is, it always boils down to the same three questions you almost automatically answer when you pick up a flower.\nYou determine how you know what you know. You determine what exists. You use your knowledge of how you know what you know (1) and what exists (2) to determine how best to act. That is how that elusive question of \u0026ldquo;how to live?\u0026rdquo; gets its answer.\nThat is how you will get your answer for yourself.\n","date":"26 August 2019","permalink":"/essays/how-to-live/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"A Simple Process for Answering the Question: \"How to Live?\""},{"content":"If you look deep enough, you\u0026rsquo;ll realize there\u0026rsquo;s no clear distinction between the disciplines of science, philosophy, and poetry, other than, perhaps, their histories, traditions, and methodologies. But even their histories are filled with people who were both poets and scientists, poets and philosophers, scientists and philosophers.\nAll of these disciplines are invested on this one project of \u0026ldquo;seeing the world clearly.\u0026rdquo;\nI have always felt it true what Thoreau said:\nThe poet uses the results of science and philosophy, and generalizes their wildest deductions.\nPoetry does not only refer to the writing of poems. It also pertains to writing, speaking, presenting anything, and dare I say living, in a poetic way. No doubt, science and philosophy, with all their serious language, could largely benefit from a poet\u0026rsquo;s tongue—a tongue which speaks a language that sounds more alluring, more down-to-earth, and yet as profound.\nOn the other hand, the poet is also reinforced by a knowledge of science and philosophy, because he is as interested to truth as he is to beauty. Truth is about \u0026ldquo;what is really there\u0026rdquo; not \u0026ldquo;what should be there\u0026rdquo;. Seeing \u0026ldquo;what is really there\u0026rdquo; is honest work, a beautiful work, a useful work—a work that scientists and philosophers are trained to do. And it is work that a true poet should also be interested to, as many poets of old have been: Empedocles, Rumi, Robert Frost, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Miguel de Unamuno, Paul Valéry, and the list goes on and on.\nPoetry is driven by a desire to see things clearly and to report what one sees (and experiences) in the most beautiful way—in a way that the poet hopes could benefit others as well as himself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a noble vocation worthy to be pursued by all thinking human beings—not just by scientists, philosophers, and yes, poets.\n","date":"27 July 2019","permalink":"/essays/seeing-the-world-clearly/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"\"Seeing the World Clearly\": The Shared Goal of Poetry, Science, and Philosophy"},{"content":"Mary Oliver\u0026rsquo;s poem \u0026ldquo;Invitation\u0026rdquo; will be one of my favorites from her. I enjoy her vivid poems best—those that paint a specific story—but, occasionally, she has these \u0026ldquo;preachy\u0026rdquo; poems where she presents her general thoughts about life. One of these poems is \u0026ldquo;Invitation.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Invitation\u0026rdquo; is a poem about doing things just for the sake of doing them. It\u0026rsquo;s a poem about things we love so much that doing them is their own purpose. It\u0026rsquo;s also a poem about \u0026ldquo;not doing\u0026rdquo;—not doing certain activities for others, not doing certain activities for money, but doing them entirely for oneself and one\u0026rsquo;s own pleasure.\nMary Oliver thinks this is a philosophy of living all by itself—a full-blown strategy that could change lives. \u0026ldquo;It could mean something. It could mean everything,\u0026rdquo; she says.\nWhether or not one approaches life in this fashion determines the quality of one\u0026rsquo;s life. I share this belief with her as well as with other thinkers whose works have influenced me like Charles Eisenstein and Austin Kleon.\nDoing things for the sake of doing them, \u0026ldquo;living in the Gift\u0026rdquo; (as Eisenstein puts it)—that realm of moneyless generosity—doing nothing, having full creative freedom, not thinking about pleasing other people, or building an audience, not presenting oneself as an unchanging \u0026ldquo;brand\u0026rdquo; or an eternal identity—all of these remind us of the value of not having anything else, other than simply being alive.\n\u0026ldquo;It is a serious thing just to be alive,\u0026rdquo; the bard of Provincetown reminded us.\nWhile busy striving for goals, we usually forget the immensity of that fact: \u0026ldquo;We are alive!\u0026rdquo;\nIs that by itself not enough?\nAll of us need to take the time to sink that fact down our bones. And we need idleness to realize that. It isn\u0026rsquo;t something that can come easily in the middle of a busy schedule. This truth needs room to breathe itself out.\nPause. Reflect on it and be grateful for being alive.\nDo nothing. Or if that\u0026rsquo;s too hard, do something without the purpose of building yourself a reputation or a retirement fund.\nDo something because it makes your heart sing the sweetest song.\nThis is the reason why I believe in hobbies and having idle time. It is also the reason why I do not sell any of my deepest passions. In fact, I have drawn a clear line between work that earns me money and work that builds my art. Some people combine the two and it works for them perfectly! Not to me. I enjoy complete creative freedom only when I see clear boundaries. If I don\u0026rsquo;t sell my art, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to compromise with the demands of an audience, a patron, an investor, or a customer. I can do what I do just for myself, freely, with the purest joy. This is what the word \u0026ldquo;Gift\u0026rdquo; means—that which is free from all the constraints of the money economy and everything attached to it—and that realm is what I want to expand through my creative work.\nFor more about the concept of Gift, read The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World by Lewis Hyde.\nYou can read Mary Oliver\u0026rsquo;s brilliant poem, \u0026ldquo;Invitation,\u0026rdquo; here.\n","date":"8 July 2019","permalink":"/essays/just-to-be-alive/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"\"It Is a Serious Thing Just To Be Alive\""},{"content":"We disagree because we don\u0026rsquo;t have direct access to the minds of others. I think that\u0026rsquo;s where disagreements ultimately originate. The only way we could have direct access to someone else\u0026rsquo;s mind is when we are that person.\nThis is why we are able to say something like, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to explain to you because you didn\u0026rsquo;t go through what I went through.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd this is exactly right. Our experiences are unique to us—to our perspective and to the time and space where our experiences happen.\nEven if someone else went through a similar experience, that experience is entirely unique on its own—it is never the same—because events happened in a different body and in a different time. Those make experiences unique. No single experience ever happens again.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t escape the following conclusion: each of us is unique in this fundamental way. No one else can have our thoughts and experiences.\nWe can never transfer these unique thoughts and experiences, we are only able to communicate them through the tools of language—sounds, words, and their meanings.\nWe cannot directly transfer our thoughts, our reasonings, and our experiences. What we are able to do is to piece together different tools of language—most of which arise from convention—and trust that the person we are talking to creates a mental picture that is an approximation of what we are trying to say. We do not have absolute control of this process. The other person may or may not understand, and if we are trying to make an argument about something, the other person may completely disagree. This is just the fact of life and we will be in a better position if we accept this and not be bothered a lot when communication fails. We can only do so much.\nI am someone who has lots of ideas about the world, and I have friends who are the same. But we read different books, we follow different people, and we were raised in different ways. When I have deep conversations about the world with them, we reach a lot of points when I fail to understand what they are trying to say or I disagree on their point of view completely. This happens both ways, and there were times when I felt like an agreement will never be reached. This happens more often than I wish, but for me, it is a testament to the uniqueness of each and everyone—something I sincerely believe.\nSuch scenarios do not just happen in intellectual conversations. They happen within the family and out there in public life. When a family member refuses to talk for fear that her perspective would be misunderstood or when politicians bicker at each other in national TV, this fact of life is in full display.\nI find that there are two attitudes in addressing situations of disagreements:\nWe could attack and hate the person behind the conflicting opinion or We accept the disagreement and continue to coexist—and even care about—the other person. When I saw Walden Bello go at it with a representative of Anakbayan in live national TV, which was followed by this, I saw two people representing two sides who chose to act according to the first attitude I mentioned. When I learned about how an activist gifted a hand-made handkerchief to a politician from the other side of an issue, in order to start a conversation with her, I saw the second attitude.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to label either of the two approaches as either good or bad. I want to objectively judge which of the two approaches give us the result that we are looking for.\nFor me, in a world where disagreements happen more than agreements, I think cultivating peaceful, nonviolent coexistence with those who disagree with us is ultimately a more effective strategy of living. It accepts that disagreement is a fact of life and goes with it rather than use force to change what is unchangeable.\nUltimately, putting ourselves intentionally in situations where we come face-to-face with disagreements—with people who think differently—make us a better person. Engaging in difficult conversations make us aware of three important things:\nHow it feels like to be in such situations, How we are inclined to react to such situations, and The weaknesses and loopholes in our own thinking, way of communicating, and overall attitude in navigating differences. Being aware of these three things within the context of a face-to-face disagreement with another person is great training.\nWhen I confront my emotions during disagreements, I become accustomed to them. Seeing my initial reaction to disagreement informs whether I tend to attack someone or listen with the intention of peaceful coexistence. Noticing the loopholes in my own thinking encourages me to research more, thus getting closer to what is true. No. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to agree with another person\u0026rsquo;s point of view. In fact, you should never agree to someone if you know what he is telling isn\u0026rsquo;t true. But you don\u0026rsquo;t have to go to a verbal or, worse, physical tussle with that person.\nPeaceful coexistence is possible. It always is.\n","date":"23 June 2019","permalink":"/essays/navigating-differences/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"The Art of Navigating Disagreements"},{"content":"Field notes and pen strapped on my bike carrier\nA couple of years ago, I was fascinated by this interview with James Prosek, a nature writer who wrote his first popular book at the age of 19. After listening to his stories, I dug him up on the internet where I found his site. There, I made an even more interesting find, which I will later on use in my own creative process.\nJames regularly goes out into the wild, in different parts of the world, to find inspiration for his art, writing, and research. He calls these visits \u0026ldquo;fieldworks.\u0026rdquo; He had a few fieldworks on fishes, one on a rare orchid, and another on monarch butterflies. At that time, I was already making daily walks and bike rides around my locale, taking photos of the surroundings and writing notes on my phone. These afternoon escapades where time spaces when I could just commune with nature, my body, and the creative muse. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really gave these everyday adventures a name. Not until I learned about James\u0026rsquo; fascinating work. Since then, I stole James\u0026rsquo; language and started calling my afternoon bike rides \u0026ldquo;fieldworks.\u0026rdquo; Doing so made my daily adventures more interesting.\nMy creative process while doing my afternoon fieldworks usually involves the following:\nI ride my bike to a particular spot: a dirt path, a road, a hill, a small piece of forested land, anywhere that is mostly silent and secluded. I do my fieldworks around 5:00 in the afternoon when farmers are making their journeys back home and the nice spots begin to welcome the silent evening. When I reach a nice spot, I begin to walk, towing my bike beside me and stoping to write notes about or take photos of interesting things I see in the environment. When I feel like writing a poem, I sit on the grass or under the tree as I wait for the words and the rhymes to come. While sitting, I take the time to watch the clouds, breathe the fresh air, and just be with the present moment. I usually make the ride home before 7:00 when there is still a few light left in the sky. Yesterday, after reading this interview with Austin Kleon, I decided to add something new to my process: for the first time, I brought a physical notebook and a pen with me in my fieldwork. Before yesterday, it was always just me and my phone.\nI really think this small change made a huge difference in my fieldwork yesterday. I noticed that I was more intentional with how I communed with my surroundings. I think this is what really happens when we revamp our creative processes. Creativity is about creation after all, and nothing gets created without \u0026ldquo;change.\u0026rdquo;\nWhen I reached my spot, I got off my bike and started walking. Then, I took the following photos.\nUnharvested crops of mais Waiting for chickens to finish their snack before I pass Electric tower, the field, and the sky Leaves with the electric tower as backdrop A stretch of farm irrigation at San Jacinto My favorite dirt road Trees conversing with the sunset After taking the photos, writing a short note about the terrain, walking, and trying out a new path, I sat down under a favorite tree and wrote on my notebook. No one else was in the field at this time: just me, my notebook, and birdsongs.\nField notes over dried leaves and straw After scribbling on my notebook, I drew the terrain in front of me. I haven\u0026rsquo;t drawn for a long time now, so I\u0026rsquo;m quite proud of my humble sketch. It\u0026rsquo;s the view of the Cordillera ranges from where I sat yesterday.\nMy attempted sketch of the field After finishing the sketch, I closed my notebook, strapped it back on my bike carrier along with the pen, and rode my bike home.\nAdventures don\u0026rsquo;t always have to be big to be awesome. They can be as equally rewarding when we do them with full intentionality . . . and when we introduce little changes such as bringing a physical notebook and a pen for the first time.\n","date":"29 April 2019","permalink":"/essays/doing-afternoon-fieldworks/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"Doing Afternoon Fieldworks"},{"content":"In Atomic Habits, James Clear details his system of behavior change based on his four laws. To establish habits that reinforce one\u0026rsquo;s desired identity, Clear suggests that these habits should be: (1) made obvious, (2) made attractive, (3) made easy, and (4) made satisfying. On the other hand, to break habits that do not support one\u0026rsquo;s desired identity, Clear argues that these habits should be: (1) made invisible, (2) made unattractive, (3) made hard, and (4) made unsatisfying. Clear ties these four laws and their inversions together with strategies like environment design, habit tracking, and deliberate practice to create a full-proof system for building good habits and breaking bad ones.\nIntroduction: My Story #Successful habit change creates a sense of control over your life, which in turn creates self-confidence.\nChanges that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.\nWe all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.\nJames Clear\u0026rsquo;s strategy involves: small habits, gradual evolution, and long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.\nJames Clear\u0026rsquo;s four-step model of habits: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nJames Clear’s four laws of behavior change evolved out of the four steps above.\nJames Clear’s framework is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. It accounts for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.\nHuman behavior is always changing, but the fundamentals of human behavior do not change. They are lasting principles you can rely on. They are ideas you can build a business, family, and life around.\nThe Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference #Chapter One: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits #The Aggregation of Marginal Gains. Break down everything you could think of that goes into what you do + improve it by 1 percent = significant increase when you put them all together.\nHabits are an investment. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.\nSuccess is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations. The small choices you take concerning your habits determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.\nFocus on your current trajectory, not your current results. It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.\nHabits are a double-edged sword. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.\nThe Plateau of Latent Potential. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. It will pay off after a certain amount.\nHabits are like trees. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. The task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.\nForget about goals; focus on systems instead. Results had very little to do with the goals you set and nearly everything to do with the systems you follow. Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are best for making progress.\nImprove for good by solving problems at the systems level. Results are not the problem. We don’t have to change the results. What we need to change are the systems that lead to the results.\nWhen you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.\nDo not restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. A system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\nIt is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.\nBad habits repeat themselves not because you have a problem but because your system is the problem.\nThe Atomic Habits System\nSmall habits Small habits that are part of a larger system Atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. Habits are the atoms of your lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. Habits build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. A regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but also the source of incredible power. Chapter Two: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) #The three layers of behavior change\nOutcome change (changing your results) Process change (changing your habits and systems) Identity change (changing your beliefs) The two directions of change\nOutcome-based habits (start habit change by focusing on what one wants to achieve) Identity-based habits (start habit change by focusing on who one wishes to become) There is an identity behind habits.\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nRealize that your old identity can sabotage your new plans for change. Before setting goals and determining your actions, consider the beliefs that drive the actions you want to take.\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes a part of your identity.\nThe more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. You start a habit because of motivation but you maintain it because it has become part of your identity.\nWhen your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\nIdentity change is a double-edged sword. You resist positive change because your old beliefs have been strongly ingrained in your psyche.\nDon’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Continuously edit your beliefs and upgrade and expand your identity.\nThe two-step process to changing your identity\nDecide the type of person you want to be Prove it to yourself with small wins. Your identity (your beliefs about yourself) emerge out of your habits (your experience). Your habits are how you embody your identity.\nThe more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.\nBuilding habits is the process of becoming yourself.\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Your identity builds up as your votes build up. Habits create results and self-confidence.\nYour goal is simply to win the majority of the time. You don’t have to be perfect. It doesn’t matter if you cast a few votes for bad behavior.\nThe formation of all habits is a feedback loop. Your habits shape your identity. Your identity shapes your habits.\nIt’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome.\nThe most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today.\nChapter Three: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps #Habits are memories of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.\nAt the beginning of building a habit, your brain is busy learning the most effective course of action.\nYour exploring will eventually lead to a reward. Your brain begins to catalog the events that preceded the reward.\nWith the repetition of a behavior, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced.\nFacing a problem repeatedly automates the brain\u0026rsquo;s response.\nThe feedback loop behind all human behavior\nTry Fail Learn Try differently Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. It’s only by making the fundamentals of life easier that you create the mental space needed for free-thinking and creativity.\nThe four steps in building a habit\nCue Craving Response Reward The human brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.\nCue is the information that predicts a reward. It triggers your brain to initiate behavior.\nCraving is the motivational force behind every habit. Thoughts and feelings transform a cue into a craving. What you crave is not the habit itself, but the change in state it delivers.\nResponse is the actual habit. It takes the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on (1) how motivated you are and (2) how much friction is associated with the behavior.\nReward is the end goal of every habit. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future.\nIf a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four steps, a behavior will not be repeated.\nThe habit loop\nCue triggers craving. Craving motivates a response. Response provides a reward. Reward satisfies the craving Craving becomes associated with the cue. The habit loop is an endless loop that is running and active during every moment you are alive.\nThe two phases of the habit loop\nProblem phase (cue, craving) Solution phase (response, reward) The purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face (want to obtain something or want to relieve pain).\nThe four laws of behavior change\nThe 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying. When all rules are satisfied creating good habits is effortless. When these rules are unsatisfied creating good habits is nearly impossible.\nThe inversion of the four laws of behavior change\nInversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying. Use the inversions to break a bad habit.\nThe key to creating good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand these fundamental laws and how to alter them to your specifications.\nThe 1st Law: Make It Obvious #Chapter Four: The Man Who Didn\u0026rsquo;t Look Right #Your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have.\nOver time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible.\nBegin the process of behavior change with awareness. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. Recognizing your habits and acknowledging the cues that trigger them makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you.\nWe need a point-and-call system for our personal lives. We need to maintain awareness of what we are actually doing.\nHabits scorecard. This is a simple exercise to become aware of your behavior.\nHow to create a habits scorecard\nMake a list of your daily habits. Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?\u0026quot; If it is a good habit write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “-“ next to it. If it is a neutral habit, write “=“. Reminders on doing the habits scorecard\nThe marks that you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals. As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is simply to notice what is actually going on. Categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run. Good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad habits will have net negative outcomes.\nCategorize habits by how they will reinforce your desired identity. Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.\nThere are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. All habits serve you in some way, even the bad ones, which is why you repeat them.\nTry point-and-calling. Say out loud the action that you are thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences more real. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list.\nChapter Five: The Best Way to Start a New Habit #Implementation intention. A plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. Leverages the two most common cues: time and location. Format: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.\u0026quot;\nHow to create an implementation intention\nFill out the following sentence: \u0026ldquo;I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] and [LOCATION].\u0026rdquo; Make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course.\nWhen the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.\nStart a new habit on the first day of the week, month, or year because a fresh start is motivating.\nHabit stacking. A special form of implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next.\nHow to apply habit stacking\nIdentify a current habit you already do each day then stack your new behavior on top. Habit stacking formula: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\u0026quot; Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current routines. Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else. Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit (if you daily, then daily). How to find the right trigger for habit stacking\nThe trigger must be highly specific and immediately actionable. The more obvious the cue to your new habit, the better your chances are to act. Chapter Six: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More #The most common form of change is not internal, but external. We are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context-dependent.\nBehavior is a function of the Person in their Environment: B = f(P,E)\nMany of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.\nVisual cues are the greatest catalyst for our behavior.\nLive and work in environments that are filled with productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.\nYou don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.\nThe cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior.\nStop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you.\nTrain yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context.\nHabits can be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a different place or a different part of your place, and create a new routine there.\nIf you want to think more creatively, take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.\nWhen you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or rearrange your current one.\n“One space, one use.” Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits and the easier ones will usually win out.\nIf your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces.\nA stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.\nChapter Seven: The Secret of Self-Control #Addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the environment.\n\u0026ldquo;Disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. They spend less time in tempting situations.\nYou can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely, even if they go unused for quite a while. Simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy.\nIn the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in.\nNo one can consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.\nEliminate your bad habit by reducing your exposure to the cue that causes it.\nInversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it invisible.\nInstead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.\nMake the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.\nThe 2nd Law: Make It Attractive #Chapter Eight: How to Make a Habit Irresistible #2nd Law of Behavior Change: The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\nWhile it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, you can make any habit more enticing.\nIt is the anticipation of a reward, not the fulfillment of it, that gets us to take action. Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.\nDesire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.\nTemptation bundling. Link an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\nCombine temptation bundling with habit stacking. Formula: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\nChapter Nine: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits #Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular:\nThe close (family and friends) The many (the tribe) The powerful (those with status and prestige) Imitate the close.\nTo build better habits, join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every day. Take this strategy further by joining a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. Remain part of the group even after achieving a goal to maintain your habits. Imitate the many.\nWhen changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. Imitate the powerful.\nWe are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. Chapter Ten: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits #Every behavior has a surface level craving, which in turn has a deeper underlying motive.\nThe underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.\nThere are many different ways to address the same underlying motive. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use.\nHabits are all about associations. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.\nThe cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. You see a cue. You make a prediction. That prediction leads to a feeling. You act based on this feeling that your prediction created.\nA craving provides a reason to act. Your craving is your desire to change your internal state because you sense that there is a gap between where you are now and where you want to be.\n“It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.” Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action.\nWhenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again.\nYou can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience.\nReframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.\nCreate a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\nThe key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. Reprogram your predictions to transform a hard habit into an attractive one.\nThe 3rd Law: Make It Easy #Chapter Eleven: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward #You just need to get your reps in. If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it.\nRepeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain.\nRepetition is a form of change. Simply putting in your reps is one of the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit.\nAutomaticity. All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior.\nHabits form based on frequency, not time. There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior.\nMake it easy. To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen is to make it easy.\nChapter Twelve: The Law of Least Effort #The Law of Least Effort. When deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\nThe less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.\nThe greater the obstacle (the more difficult the habit), the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.\nMake your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it.\nYou could do the hard work on good days, but during tough days, you should be able to do the habit easily.\nUse environment design to make actions or habits easier. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible and doing the wrong thing is as difficult as possible.\nHabits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life.\nAvoid starting habits in high-friction environments. Or lessen friction at home or office.\nAddition by subtraction. When we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort.\nRedesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do. Reduce the friction associated with good habits. Increase the friction associated with bad habits.\nChapter Thirteen: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule #Habits are automatic choices that can be completed in just a few seconds but can shape the actions and conscious decisions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.\nDecisive moments. Moments in a day that deliver an outsized impact. They set the options available to your future self.\nDecisive moments are important because our choice during a decisive moment sets the trajectory for how we spend the next chunk of our time. Your options are constrained by what’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.\nThe Two-minute Rule. When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.\nMake your habits as easy as possible to start. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy.\nTo figure out a gateway habit, map out your goals on a scale from \u0026ldquo;very easy\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;very hard.\u0026rdquo;\nAt the beginning, focus only on mastering the habit of showing up. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.\nA habit must be established before it can be improved. You have to standardize before you can optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.\nWhat happens after you master the art of showing up\nThe first two minutes become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. The ritual is the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely you get into a flow. If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then stop. It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing. Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.\nThe secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good.” (Ernest Hemingway)\nIt’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.\nOnce you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with “habit shaping” to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal.\nMaster the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process (focus on just the first two minutes and master that stage before moving on to the next level. You’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while still keeping your focus on the first two minutes of the behavior. Chapter Fourteen: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible #Make your bad habits more difficult by creating a commitment device.\nCommitment device. A choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. A way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones while your mind is in the right place rather than waiting to see where your desires take you in the moment.\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act.\nOnetime actions/choices. Single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.\nYou may use technology to automate good habits and eliminate bad ones so that you can spend your effort on the tasks that machines cannot do yet.\nBy utilizing commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can create an environment of inevitability where good habits are guaranteed.\nThe 4th Law: Make It Satisfying #Chapter Fifteen: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change #Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.\nWe are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.\nImmediate-return environment. Your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.\nDelayed-return environment. You work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.\nThe human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.\nYou value the present more than the future.\nWith our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad.With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.\nThe brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions.\nThe more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.\nUpdated Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.\nIf you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff.\nAt decisive moments, add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and add a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\nThe vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful even if it’s in a small way. To stay on track, you need immediate rewards. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.\nReinforcement. Ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish, thus increasing the rate of a behavior.\nUse reinforcement when dealing with habits of avoidance. Whenever you resist temptation, give yourself and immediate reward. This makes avoidance visible and makes doing nothing satisfying.\nSelect short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.\nIdentity can become a reinforcer. Eventually, as intrinsic rewards kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you.\nIt takes time for evidence to accumulate and a new identity to emerge.\nImmediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.\nChapter Sixteen: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day #Visual measures reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.\nHabit tracker. A simple way to measure whether you did a habit. Basic format: Get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine.\nHabit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. Habit tracking simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.\nBenefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious. Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day.\nBenefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive. The most effective form of motivation is progress. Through habit tracking, each small win feeds your desire.\nBenefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying. Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to mark an X on the calendar.\nHabit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.\nHow to make tracking easier?\nWhenever possible, measurement should be automated. Manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten. Record each measurement immediately after a habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].\nEvery habit streak ends at some point. Have a good plan for when your habits slide off track.\nPerfection in being consistent with your habits is not possible.\n“Never miss twice.” The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast.\nChapter Seventeen: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything #Inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change: Make it immediately unsatisfying.\nAdd an instant cost to a bad habit to prevent it.\nThe strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.\nThe more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior.\nThe more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence individual behavior.\nHabit contract. A straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any bad habit. A verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you. It adds a social cost to any behavior because it makes the costs of violating promises public and painful.\nHaving an accountability parter is helpful. Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. Knowing that you will fail to uphold your promises to others is an immediate punishment. You can automate this process.\nAdvanced Tactics: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great #Chapter Eighteen: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don\u0026rsquo;t) #Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities.\nGenes provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.\nCompetence is highly dependent on context.\nIf you want to be truly great, selecting the right place to focus is crucial.\nGenes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of opportunity.\nThe areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying.\nDirect your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.\nBundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality.\nIf you are not genetically inclined to a particular habit, use environment design.\nYou should build habits that work for your personality.\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find it.\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful.\nPick the right habit and progress is easy.\nExplore/exploit trade-off\nExploration at the beginning of a new activity Goal: Try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found, but keep experimenting occasionally. If you are winning, you exploit. If you are losing, you explore. Work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time, and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent If you have a lot of time, explore. If you have little time, exploit. Questions to narrow in on the habits and areas to focus on.\nWhat feels like fun to me, but work to others? What makes me lose track of time? Where do I get greater returns than the average person? What comes naturally to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me? Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.\nIf you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one.\nEveryone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. Combine these areas to create your own game. Win by being different. Combine your skills to reduce competition and stand out. Rewrite the rules to shortcut the need for a genetic advantage. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.\nSpecialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.\nIf you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.\nOur genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They tell us what to work hard on.\nThe better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.\nWe can know where to spend our time and energy. We can know which types of opportunities to look for and which to avoid. Focus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else.\nWork hard on the things that come easy. To ensure that your habits remain satisfying over the long-run, pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.\nChapter Nineteen: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work #The way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”\nThe Goldilocks Rule (Yerkes-Dodson law). Humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.\nWhen you are starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. Once a habit is established, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways, so that you are kept engaged. This will also get you to a flow state.\nYou need to regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress to stay motivated.\nDesire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure.\nAt some point, you will have to fall in love with boredom. You should be ready to do the work even when it’s not convenient or exciting so that you become consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.\nChapter Twenty: The Downside of Creating Good Habits #The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors.\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. You need a combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice to become exceptional.\nThe process of mastery\nNarrow your focus to a tiny element of success. Repeat it until you have internalized the skill. Use this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit-building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.\nTo avoid complacency, to make you aware of where to improve, and to ensure that you are spending your time on the right things, establish a system for reflection and review, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complex.\nJames Clear’s two primary modes of reflection and review are his Annual Review and Integrity Report.\nAnnual Review. (1) What went well this year? (2) What didn’t go so well this year? (3) What did I learn?\nIntegrity Report. (1) What are the core values that drive my life and work? (2) How am I living and working with integrity right now? (3) How can I set a higher standard in the future?\nReflection and review also allows you time to revisit your identity.\nAs you latch on to a new identity, that identity can also hold you back from the next level of growth. Your identity creates “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from growing.\nTo prevent an identity from jeopardizing growth avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. Redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.\nChoose a flexible identity, which works with the changing circumstances.\nLife is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check-in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.\nConclusion #Commit to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements.\nSuccess is not a goal to reach. It is a system to improve, and endless process to refine.\nWhenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the next bottleneck. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.\nThe secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements.\nAppendix #Little Lessons from the Four Laws #Happiness is simply the absence of desire.\nSuffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it. Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.\nEmotions drive behavior.\nWe can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.\nYour response tends to follow your emotions.\nThoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion. Suffering drives progress.\nThe desire for a change in state is the source of all suffering and all progress. Your actions reveal how badly you want something.\nIf you keep on saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.\nResisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. Feelings come both before and after the behavior.\nCue -\u0026gt; Craving (Feeling) -\u0026gt; Response -\u0026gt; Reward (Feeling) How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel. Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.\nHope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.\nAt the beginning, when there is no experience to give feedback, hope is high. The second time, experience provides feedback to the initial expectation and hope declines. Hope is replaced by acceptance.

I will be using the same guide questions I used in my 2017 review, all of which I borrowed from James Clear. The questions are:\nWhat went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What am I working towards? Last year, I took James Clear\u0026rsquo;s questions and applied them to the three main life areas that I track. Back then, these life areas were named:\nSelf-care Personal transition My mission As I developed a better understanding of how the right categories can be used to sharpen our thinking, I have decided to settle on the following names, all of which capture the same concepts I used last year but in a broader level. The new names are:\nHealth Sustenance Meaning Why I chose these words to capture the broad areas I want to keep track of in my life will be explained in a different post. For now, it will suffice to say that I use health to refer to mental, physical, and social wellbeing; sustenance to refer to all kinds of actions I need to take to keep myself alive through material and financial resources; and meaning to refer to everything I do to flourish.\nFeel free to use my format to write your own Annual Review.\n1. What went well this year? #Health # I continue to maintain a daily meditation practice, carrying over this healthy habit from last year and a few years back then. I completed all five days of a sitting meditation retreat last November. In previous years, I was only able to finish at most three days. But this year, I was finally able to stay until the end and with great reward! I was able to quit coffee and alcohol for more than one month and my sleep immediately improved. I have returned to drinking coffee in the morning only. I was able to improve my sleep for about a month while quitting coffee and alcohol. I have added a new habit to my morning routine. After drinking two glasses of water, I immediately take one tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar. It has an immediate mental kick, which I find stronger than coffee! Plus, it has a lot of health benefits. I\u0026rsquo;m going strong with my five-minute journal practice. For almost two years now, I have been writing gratitude entries and setting intentions in the morning while reviewing my day in the evening. In the second half of the year, I went through a grieving process, which I continue to go through until now. While the process is painful, it was a great learning experience. I learned a lot about how to cope with grief in a healthy way and how to prepare for the inevitable losses that all of us will ultimately face. It\u0026rsquo;s a lesson I haven\u0026rsquo;t learned even after going through depression so I am grateful that I experienced it this year. While in the grieving process, I deepened my relationship with two friends. I was also able to cultivate existing but forsaken friendships with four people. What\u0026rsquo;s more, I was able to start a few more friendships. It\u0026rsquo;s easy for me to count my friends because I try to connect with people in a really deep level. When you are my friend, it isn\u0026rsquo;t fleeting stuff. We\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing our deepest thoughts. That\u0026rsquo;s just who I am. And the people drawn to me seem to be like that too. Awesome. Sustenance # I didn\u0026rsquo;t stress myself a lot about money this year because my savings are pretty intact. By the end of the year, I took on more work that I did the past months to recover the savings I used up. But for the most part of this year, I dedicated my energy to studying philosophy, grieving, and exploring other art forms like poetry, photography, and translation. While I am yet to really dig it, my exposure to Austrian Economics was really helpful in improving my understanding of money and the material world. I invested on a wireless hair clipper and I taught myself to shave my own hair. I have chosen a haircut that I can do myself (the buzz cut), and I have been cutting myself for at least three months now. As long as I take good care of my hair clipper and keep a simple haircut, I will be saving around one million pesos until the day I die. This and other similar decisions were inspired by Jacob Lund Fisker and the Early Retirement Extreme book and community, which is really a resource about extreme frugality more than it is a resource on early retirement. I also invested on a bike repair toolbox, which I used to learn fixing my own bike. I ride my bike almost every day as a form of exercise and meditation. I also use it as my form of transportation when visiting our place in Santa Barbara. While I still ride public transportation for longer trips, I don\u0026rsquo;t own a car and will never own one. If I will own any vehicle, it will be always be the bike. Learning to repair it myself is another form of investment that lessens my dependence on the money economy in the long term. Meaning # I dug a lot of podcast episodes this year, and I shared a few of my favorite podcasts. I read a few important books this year, which I shared with you in my previous post. I have started writing poetry, and every time I write a poem I really feel replenished creatively. It\u0026rsquo;s a practice I will continue to deepen in 2019. I have also started writing translations both in Filipino and in Pangasinan. I took a lot of photographs this year, which also means I took a lot of afternoon walks and bike rides. Earlier this year, I set myself out to study philosophy independently. While the field is so wide and there is a lot more to study, I feel like I did a lot of important work this year with regards to improving the way I think about things. I was able to keep a consistent newsletter publishing routine earlier this year and people really loved it! I took a few months break but I\u0026rsquo;m back to writing them again, because I enjoy sharing stuff and my friends love reading them. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t subscribed, please do so here. 2. What didn\u0026rsquo;t go so well this year? #Health # I began tapering my psychiatric medications early this year but have to return to my previous dose to support my grieving in the second half of the year. While it was the right decision to pause tapering, it would have been great to end the year with lesser dependence on these drugs. I\u0026rsquo;ll try again this 2019. While, I was able to experiment on sleeping better, I\u0026rsquo;m still not sleeping enough this year. I quit coffee and alcohol and drank only pure water for more than a month. But for the most part this year, my diet isn\u0026rsquo;t as great as I want it to be. Because I repaired my bike, I think I moved better this year than I did last year. But I still have to keep my physical activity more consistent. While I did well developing my relationships this year, my state of social health is not yet flourishing as I want it to be. The biggest challenge is geography really. My people are miles away from me. Scheduling time with the people I love needs more effort to be consistent and improve in this area. Sustenance # My goal entering 2018 was to volunteer in farms, practice extreme frugality, and advocate for gift economics. This plan has to pause and be reassessed after I realized I really wanted to focus on philosophy this year. While not really a failure (because I invite trial-and-error in my lifestyle), this change caused me a little stress this year. Luckily, through some advice from a friend and personal reflection, I was able to continue studying philosophy without stressing much about money this year. Because I worked less this year, my savings dropped. Also, I noticed that during the grieving process I tend to spend more money for food and entertainment. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too hard on myself during this difficult time. Luckily, as my emotions got more stable, so was my spending. Slowly, I\u0026rsquo;m going back to being more mindful with how I use my money. Meaning # This year was a great creative year. I tend to use art as my refuge when I\u0026rsquo;m going through a tough time. This means I spent most of the year at home doing stuff. So if there\u0026rsquo;s anything that didn\u0026rsquo;t go so well this year, which I did more often in previous years, it\u0026rsquo;s probably traveling. It\u0026rsquo;s not that bad. I mean, while traveling can fuel creativity, it can also disturb routines that build creativity. So not traveling a lot this year was okay. But next year, I hope to travel more especially with friends. 3. What am I working towards? #Health # In the coming year, I will continue to grieve, I will give myself enough time to do that. I will also be working on my habits again using James Clear\u0026rsquo;s Atomic Habits. Specifically, I will be targeting sleep, nutrition, and exercise. Sustenance # Since I have to let go of this area in 2018 so I can focus on doing philosophy last year, I\u0026rsquo;ll slowly get back to working on my material needs and finances. For starters, I plan on creating a personal economic plan using concepts and tools that I already know and use. I also plan to share these concepts and tools to my readers and friends because a lot of us really need it. If I can finish creating a book or a course on this subject, I\u0026rsquo;ll let you know as soon as I start creating it. Meaning # After my exposure to philosophy last year, this 2019 I will take my project to the next level by writing more about what I am learning here in the website. My ultimate goal is to write a book about my personal philosophy of living. Before I could take on that monumental task, I need to do a lot of research, reflection, and preliminary writing. As always, I will be using this website to create the work I want to create. Aside from continuing to build my worldview, I plan to continue all the other art forms I started exploring during the second half of last year (poetry and translations). I also plan to explore more music. In fact, I have started a musical diary which I learned from Austin Kleon. I\u0026rsquo;ll be creating two diaries: one for international music and one for original Pilipino music (OPM). My OPM 2019 playlist is up on Spotify. I also plan to start a hobby this year. While I\u0026rsquo;m open to all options, drawing is something that is really starting to call me. I used to draw really well when I was younger. Now I have completely forgotten how to draw. It\u0026rsquo;s probably time to get back to doing it. I\u0026rsquo;ll be publishing more consistently in this website and in my email newsletter. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to set hard goals, never did. So another creative project I might start this year is a podcast/oral history project which will feature interviews with Filipino friends and people living not-so-conventional lives. I enjoy deep conversations and this is probably a good opportunity to make myself accountable for doing creative work while engaging in something that I really love. Bonus question: What did I learn this year? #James Clear actually changed his third question (What am I working towards) with this new question (What did I learn this year?). While I still think the old question is useful for an annual review because it prepares one for the coming year, I find the new question interesting so I\u0026rsquo;ll give it a try.\nHere are some of the many lessons I learned this year.\nMarry well. It\u0026rsquo;s a phrase I\u0026rsquo;m borrowing from Austin Kleon and will use it the way he used it, broadly. A creative needs to choose who to associate him/herself with whether that\u0026rsquo;s a life partner, a creative partner, a client, everyone, wisely.\nLife is a big game of grieving. Almost everything in life involves change. Change, in turn, involves lost. While we were taught how to \u0026ldquo;have\u0026rdquo; things, we were almost never taught how to \u0026ldquo;let them go.\u0026rdquo; There is probably no skill more critical in life than learning to grieve and to let go.\nThe best people to be with are not necessarily the people I have similar interests or philosophies with. The best people to be with are those I can be completely myself with, without judgment. I notice that I become really relaxed and genuine when I\u0026rsquo;m with high school friends. These people do not share the passions and the identities that I have accumulated through the years. But that\u0026rsquo;s where the magic happens; what I share with them is that piece of me unchanged throughout the years. That\u0026rsquo;s why hanging out with this people is really refreshing.\nIf we let go of our beliefs on what is objectively good or objectively bad, we see the world clearly, we see others as they really are and not as we think they are. This is Eastern philosophy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;non-judgment\u0026rdquo; and Western philosophy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;amoralism.\u0026rdquo; The more we let go of wanting others to act a certain way, the better our chance of really connecting with them, and thus the better our chance of achieving peace.\nFocus on the fundamentals. In philosophy, this is logic. Get your logic wrong and the rest of your thinking will be flawed. Believe in logical contradiction and your entire worldview will be irrational. The same goes with building habits. To master behavior change, focus on the tiny actions you take every day and let go of the grand goals.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s everything for now. Here\u0026rsquo;s for a better year ahead for all of us! As always, thank you for reading.\n","date":"2 January 2019","permalink":"/essays/2018-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2018 Annual Review"},{"content":"While editing a photography book, I came in contact with this interesting term that food photographers use to refer to the food that they ultimately choose to feature in their photographs. They call this food the \u0026ldquo;hero food.\u0026rdquo; I love the term, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s apt given the things photographers do just to find the best-looking food for their work.\nFor this post, which I hope to be writing every year, I\u0026rsquo;m borrowing the idea of the \u0026ldquo;hero food\u0026rdquo; to create a new term, the \u0026ldquo;hero book.\u0026rdquo; As a reader, I also feel like I always put an unusual amount of effort in finding the best books on subjects that I\u0026rsquo;m interested in. Luckily, sometimes, the books find me.\nThis year was another great reading year for me. I found a few great hero books that changed the way I see the world. While I may read less books that most readers, I see to it that I make the most use of my books. I have a reading system, which I will share in a future post. This system always involves me creating a book summary of the book I read.\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing with you four of my hero books for 2018. I\u0026rsquo;m also including a few runner ups, which you might want to check out.\nSquare One: The Foundations of Knowledge | Steve Patterson #Early this year (or perhaps it was December last year, I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure), I made a serendipitous find that changed the way I see the world forever.\nI was doing a personal research about independent scholarship, and because I have always been a heavy podcast listener, I was listening to this podcast episode by Tom Woods. In that episode, he was talking to this person who was claiming to be \u0026ldquo;a philosopher who works outside of academia.\u0026rdquo; He talked about the challenges he face as an independent scholar, including some beef he had with an academic who ridiculed his work on social media.\nBecause it\u0026rsquo;s pretty rare to find an independent scholar courageously doing his work outside the comforts of the university, and getting bullied at the same time, I dug into this man\u0026rsquo;s work. I started listening to Steve Patterson\u0026rsquo;s podcasts. I read many of his articles. And, of course, I read his best book so far, Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge.\nThis book was written not for academics but for every honest human being interested about how to think better about the world. It destroys the wall \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; philosophers have built around their field. The book was shorter than most philosophy books, it got straight to the point, and reading it prepared me to think better.\nThe book inspired me to dive into philosophy and, more importantly, to reflect on my own beliefs about the world. You won\u0026rsquo;t see the world the same way after reading this book. I highly recommend it.\nRead my summary of Square One: The Foundations of Knowledge.\nWhat Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy | Thomas Nagel #Square One lead me to seriously consider studying philosophy. But philosophy books are too many and too diverse that someone starting out can easily be overwhelmed. I Googled for advice on where to start, and one book was constantly mentioned: What Does It All Mean? by Thomas Nagel.\nSteve Patterson\u0026rsquo;s writing was clearer and more succinct, but Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s writing was pretty simple too. He writes better than most academics who tend to ramble around jargons.\nThe book introduces the reader to nine major problems in philosophy. What I like best about this book is written in the Introduction. There, Thomas Nagel talked about his philosophy (pun not intended) on how philosophy should be taught or learned.\nIn his own words:\nBefore learning a lot of philosophical theories it is better to get puzzled about the philosophical questions which those theories try to answer. And the best way to do that is to look at some possible solutions and see what is wrong with them.\nI like this approach. It encourages me to rely on my own thinking first before relying on others. So, I haven\u0026rsquo;t read a lot of philosophy books since this one. What I do is to journal my own answers to the questions based on my own analysis and reflection. This is very much unlike how most would do it in the university. My professors at the university would pour every reading they fancy into us, thinking that the more we read about something, the more we understand it. But philosophy is not really about how much books you\u0026rsquo;ve read. It\u0026rsquo;s about how much you\u0026rsquo;ve practiced philosophizing using your own mental abilities.\nRead my summary of What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy.\nBeyond Morality | Richard Garner #This is easily the most difficult book I read this year. But I read it anyway because I know of no other book that talks about the same subject.\nThe reason why I dove into philosophy this year was because I feel like I have been perplexed by the same old question my whole life: How should I live? After doing some reading in philosophy, I immediately realized that the question that was bothering me was the main question asked in one of philosophy\u0026rsquo;s major branches: ethics.\nIn ethics, the reasons behind our actions are explored, and the prevailing way of thinking in this field is that our actions are either \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;good.\u0026rdquo; We act out actions because they are \u0026ldquo;good.\u0026rdquo; We avoid certain ones because they are \u0026ldquo;bad.\u0026rdquo;\nSurprisingly, there is a way of thinking that completely rejects this dominant perspective. Moral or ethical nihilists believe that there are no absolute and objective moral standards. Things are not \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bad.\u0026rdquo; They\u0026rsquo;re just what they are.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a difficult position to wrap one\u0026rsquo;s head around. But after I examined their arguments, they made perfect sense. Beyond Morality extends the arguments of moral nihilism to and admonition to abandon all forms of moral language. According to Garner, this position, which he calls \u0026ldquo;moral abolitionism,\u0026rdquo; is not only logically sound; it might just be the missing solution to a world that has gone \u0026ldquo;immoral.\u0026rdquo;\nHe closed the book through these words:\nIf we can give up moralist language as well as moralist beliefs, if we can learn to operate beyond morality and beyond duplicity about morality, we will find ourselves in a position to be more honest and straightforward with ourselves and others. This is bound to result in a better understanding of what is happening—all around. Then, if our wider and deeper knowledge unlocks our compassion, as I predict it will, we will have transcended any need for the illusions of morality, and we and others can be comfortable with our spontaneity and with the conventions that give a familiar and comfortable structure to our lives.\nAtomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones | James Clear #Another great quote from Richard Garner\u0026rsquo;s Beyond Morality is the following:\nWe are not going to get peace and happiness by arguing that war is morally wrong and happiness a human right. Peace and happiness will come only when we develop habits and institutions that generate and nourish them - habits of cooperation and consideration, habits of generosity and of yielding for the sake of harmony.\nI am citing this here because it relates with perhaps the most useful book I read this year, Atomic Habits by James Clear. This is his first book. He released it in October and instantly became a New York Times bestseller.\nWhile the first three books in this list shaped the way I see the world, it is James Clear\u0026rsquo;s book which just might put all those philosophizing into practical application. Like Richard Garner said in the quote above, it is through habits that we achieve the things that we long for. These include both personal goals and societal goals.\nI am quite proud to say that I believed on James Clear\u0026rsquo;s work even before he became a bestselling author. He\u0026rsquo;s a big influence in the work that I do. Read this book to know what I mean.\nRead my summary of Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones.\nRunner-ups # Jon Kabat-Zinn, Wherever You Go, There You Are Amy Webb, Data, A Love Story John W.

Here\u0026rsquo;s for a new year of great books!\n***\nI stole the idea for this post from the great Austin Kleon.\n","date":"23 December 2018","permalink":"/essays/my-hero-books-of-2018/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My Hero Books of 2018"},{"content":"Most of my friends know about it. If you\u0026rsquo;ve been reading my blog for some time there\u0026rsquo;s a big chance you know about it. I have written about it in the past and will continue to do so.\nI was diagnosed with Major Depression in March 2011, a few weeks before the end of my third year in college. I will miss a year of college because I was put on psychiatric medications and had to recuperate from all the stress.\nIt was the single biggest event that changed my life (so far). I was 19 then. I am 26 now. And this year, about a month after I turned 26 (February 9), I celebrated seven years of coming out of depression. Yes, celebrate. Because no matter how terrible the experience was, I always see it as the beginning of my transformation. I grew older, wiser, more mature after the experience.\nToday, I want to share with you 7 lessons I learned (and continue to learn) since my depressive episode in 2011.\n1. Personal resolve—more than anything else—will save your life. #Here\u0026rsquo;s a quote that stuck to me for a long time, from Dr. David D. Burns\u0026rsquo; popular book Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy:\n\u0026hellip;the crucial decision to try to help yourself is the key that will allow you to feel better as soon as possible, regardless of how severe your mood disturbance might seem to be.\u0026quot;\n2. You shouldn’t blame anyone for your misfortune. Be totally responsible for your own life. #After getting help in 2011 and when the sleeping pills started to kick in, I gained enough energy to start blaming other people about what happened to me. My parents became the number one culprit.\nI\u0026rsquo;m old enough to realize that I was greatly mistaken. I was totally responsible for what happened to me. And I am totally responsible for making it all right. The people around me are only there to support me. And even if they contributed to the suffering, they too suffered. We are all victims of forces beyond our control and the best way forward is to tackle the problem head-on, together.\n3. Remember: It is not just you who is suffering. The people around you are also suffering. #It is difficult to see this at first. Depression has an unbelievable way of sucking you into a vortex where what only mattered was you, you, and you.\nA few years after my episode, I chanced upon a notebook by accident. It contained notes my mother wrote to herself during the darkest days of my depression. While I was suffering, she was also suffering, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t see this before. I see it now.\n4. Learn to look at depression as a friend rather than an enemy. #With all the pain it brings anyone, it is only natural to see depression in a dark, bitter light. Time heals everything and time brings perspective.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quote by Thomas Moore from his contribution to the anthology Sacred Sorrows: Embracing and Transforming Depression. His chapter was aptly titled \u0026ldquo;Gifts of Depression: Healing the Wounded Soul.\u0026rdquo;\nDepression grants the gift of experience not as a literal fact but as an attitude toward yourself. You get a sense of having lived through something, of being older and wiser. You know that life is suffering, and that knowledge makes a difference. You can\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the bouncy, carefree innocence of youth any longer, a realization that entails both sadness because of the loss, and pleasure in a new feeling of self-acceptance and self-knowledge.\u0026quot;\n5. Always try to be in the present moment and live one day at a time. #I don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other lesson I learned since my depression which was as useful, practical, and life-transforming as this one. The major reason why I had depression, in the first place, was that I took on a lot of stress from going after goals that run five years, six years, in the future. I thought that the \u0026ldquo;going after\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;future\u0026rdquo; will give me joy. Well, turns out, I\u0026rsquo;m wrong.\nToday, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult for me to set goals for more than one or two years. And it\u0026rsquo;s even more difficult for me to track whether or not I\u0026rsquo;m getting \u0026ldquo;there.\u0026rdquo; Most of the time, I\u0026rsquo;m just here, in this day, this moment. It feels like I\u0026rsquo;m not getting anywhere most of the time. But it also feels more calm, blissful, genuine.\n6. Life is all about people. #Depression taught me a lot about people. I don\u0026rsquo;t know everything and I\u0026rsquo;m still a work in progress in terms of my relationships. But I can\u0026rsquo;t live without the people in my life. I seek intimate conversations and genuine bonding with friends and family more than anything else.\n7. Depression may be a call to slow down—stay small, make life simple, and do what makes you feel good. #My choice for a simpler life is a direct corollary of my experience with depression. I understand that some people have a zest for the adrenaline that comes from going after really big and adventurous goals. But that\u0026rsquo;s not me and I\u0026rsquo;m already okay with that.\nDepression was telling me something and I\u0026rsquo;ve opened myself up to listen to it.\nIn his book Let Your Life Speak: Listening to the Voice of Vocation, the Quaker author and activist Parker Palmer admitted that he too suffered from depression. Palmer talked about an instance when his therapist suggested that he look at depression, not as an enemy, but as a friend who is pressing him to the ground.\nPalmer\u0026rsquo;s reaction to this suggestion was, at first, mixed:\nAmid the assaults I was suffering, the suggestion that depression was my friend seemed impossibly romantic, even insulting. But something in me knew that down, down to the ground, was the direction of wholeness, thus allowing that image to begin its slow work of healing in me.\nI started to understand that I had been living an ungrounded life, living at an altitude that was inherently unsafe. The problem with living at high altitude is simple: when we slip, as we always do, we have a long, long way to fall, and the landing may well kill us. The grace of being pressed down to the ground is also simple: when we slip and fall, it is usually not fatal, and we can get back up.\nLater, Palmer became convinced that depression was teaching him something important:\nDepression was, indeed, the hand of a friend trying to press me down to ground on which it was safe to stand—the ground of my own truth, my own nature, with its complex mix of limits and gifts, liabilities and assets, darkness and light.\nDepression is something that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be experienced by most people. It\u0026rsquo;s painful and going through it entails a lot of loss and despair. Nevertheless, it is part of being human and even if you do not go through it, it is inevitable that you are going to learn its lessons through a different experience.\nFor those who are going through depression and those who will go through it, rest assured that there is a way out of the pain and suffering. But there is no escaping the lessons. They will be here to stay with you forever. And you will be grateful for them.\n","date":"12 June 2018","permalink":"/essays/seven-lessons-i-learned-since-my-depression-in-2011/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"7 Lessons I Learned Since My Depression In 2011"},{"content":"Naglalakad ako sa harapan ng Bahay ng Alumni sa UP Diliman. Tulad ng ordinaryong pedestrian, sa sidewalk ako tumatapak.\nHindi ko maalala kung lalaki siya o babae pero sa sandaling iyon makakasalubong ko siya.

Thomas Nagel explores nine questions that philosophers have been trying to answer for thousands of years. Nagel believes that engaging with these questions directly is the best way to start a study of philosophy. He introduces the beginning philosopher to the questions and the most common arguments about them. Within his discussion, Nagel also inserts his own stand on the problems but cautions the reader not to rely on his conclusions. Instead, he repeatedly encourages the reader to think through the questions using her own reasoning.\nChapter One: Introduction #Chapter Summary: Philosophy is best studied by engaging with the philosophical questions first before anything else.\nBegin your study of philosophy by thinking about the questions directly. Examine some possible solutions and look for their pitfalls. Do this and you will be in a better position to read the works of others. Philosophy is different from science or mathematics because it does not rely on experiments or formal methods of proof. The main concern of philosophy is to question and understand the very common ideas that we take for granted. Philosophy can be difficult because the more basic the ideas one is trying to investigate, the fewer the available tools. A philosopher cannot assume too much. A philosopher can\u0026rsquo;t take things for granted. Chapter Two: How Do We Know Anything? #Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of how you know anything, ponder on (1) whether there is really a physical world outside your mind or if your mind is the only thing that exists, and (2) consider whether or not it is all right to go on believing on an external world even if it does not exist.\nThe inside of your own mind is the only thing you can be sure of. To conclude that a physical world outside your mind because you \u0026ldquo;sense\u0026rdquo; it is a weak proposition. Trying to prove the reliability of your senses by appealing to your senses is circular reasoning. Ponder on this: What if all your experiences are just a giant dream with no external world outside it? If the \u0026ldquo;giant dream\u0026rdquo; exists, then any evidence you use to prove that there is a physical world outside your mind will just really be part of the \u0026ldquo;giant dream.\u0026rdquo; All evidence about what could be an outside world should come through your mind. Ponder on this: Maybe, there is no physical world outside your mind. Maybe, only you, the subject of experience, is the one that exists. \u0026ldquo;Solipsism\u0026rdquo; is the view that your mind is the only thing that exists. Solipsism is a conclusion that is more than the evidence warrants. Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s position: \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know anything beyond your impressions and experiences.\u0026rdquo; This position is also called \u0026ldquo;skepticism.\u0026rdquo; A stronger form of skepticism proposes that you can\u0026rsquo;t be sure that you existed in the past because all you have to go on are the present contents of your mind. Argument: \u0026ldquo;There is a physical world outside your mind because your internal experiences have external causes.\u0026rdquo; Skeptic\u0026rsquo;s answer: \u0026ldquo;Even if external causes exist, they cannot be observed directly. They have to go through the mind. How can you be sure about their properties and existence?\u0026rdquo; Science doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold the final answer to whether or not there is a physical world outside your mind. Science relies on observation through the senses. If we can\u0026rsquo;t establish the reliability of our senses, we can\u0026rsquo;t establish the reliability of science. Verificationism is the belief that without the possibility of a correct view of how things are, the thought that one\u0026rsquo;s impressions are not true is meaningless. According to verificationism, if a physical world outside your mind does not exist, then what seems to be an illusion is actually perceptions of reality. Verificationism requires that reality is what we can observe. \u0026ldquo;Egocentric predicament\u0026rdquo; is the problem of not being able to see reality as it is because of being trapped inside one\u0026rsquo;s mind. It is difficult to escape our acceptance of the existence of a physical world outside our minds. Chapter Three: Other Minds #Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of whether or not other minds exist, (1) explore what you can really know beyond the contents of your mind, and (2) consider the possibility that there might be much less or much more conscious life than you assume.\nThe only experience you can actually have is your own. Your belief that other people have their own experiences is based on your observation of their behavior. You can\u0026rsquo;t enter their minds and experience it yourself. It is uncertain whether two human beings could have the same exact experience. Physical differences and other factors may contribute to differences in experience. The differences in sensual experiences among human beings may or may not be radical. We can\u0026rsquo;t know 100%. The experiences of human beings could be entirely different among each other. Radical conclusion: Because you can\u0026rsquo;t experience other people\u0026rsquo;s mental lives directly, it is plausible to conclude that other minds do not exist. If other minds do not exist, their physical behavior is caused by physical factors. You can\u0026rsquo;t be sure 100% that other minds exist just because other people act and talk. You don\u0026rsquo;t see the connection between other people\u0026rsquo;s inner experience and their behavior \u0026ldquo;directly.\u0026rdquo; To \u0026ldquo;immediately\u0026rdquo; believe that other minds exist just because it \u0026ldquo;seems\u0026rdquo; obvious is to rely on instinct, not knowledge. If you accept that there are other people who have minds, you should be ready to accept that animals, plants, cells, nonliving things, and even machines \u0026ldquo;could\u0026rdquo; have minds too. The only way you can be sure that other people, other organisms, and other things have minds is to observe \u0026ldquo;directly\u0026rdquo; the correlations between their internal experience and their physical manifestations. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t have any capability to observe these correlations \u0026ldquo;directly,\u0026rdquo; we can\u0026rsquo;t be 100% sure about the presence or the absence of other minds. Chapter Four: The Mind-Body Problem #Chapter Summary: There seem to be two states happening within a person: mental states and physical states. How these states interact and whether or not they are mutually exclusive is a problem that has bothered philosophers for thousands of years.\nWhat happens to the mind seems to depend on what happens to the body. Ponder this: Is your mind something different from your brain, though connected to it? Or is it part of your brain? The mind is different from the brain because brain processes can be observed by an outsider but the mind (feelings, sensations, experiences) cannot be observed by the same outsider. If the contents of the mind cannot be observed by an outsider in a way that she can observe the contents of the brain, then the mind cannot be a \u0026ldquo;physical\u0026rdquo; part or state of the brain. \u0026ldquo;Dualism\u0026rdquo; is the view that a person is made up of two substances: matter and mind. Another way to put this is that a person has a body and a soul. \u0026ldquo;Physicalism\u0026rdquo; also known as \u0026ldquo;materialism\u0026rdquo; is the view that a person consists of noting but physical matter. Therefore, the mind and its contents are simply physical states of the brain. There is only the body, there is no soul. \u0026ldquo;Dual aspect theory\u0026rdquo; is an alternative to both dualism and physicalism. It is the view that a brain is an object with both physical and mental properties. Mental states can\u0026rsquo;t simply be explained by purely physical causes and effects. Mental states \u0026ldquo;feel\u0026rdquo; a certain way that is different from a physical phenomenon. Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s position: There is a physical reality that people can observe from the outside. There is a mental reality that individuals experience from the inside. This mental reality could also occur to other organisms. To have a purely physical theory about the mind and the body, and therefore the entire universe, the mind or consciousness has to be identified with some physical state. So far, it is impossible to have a unified physical theory of the universe because arguments against it are strong enough to refute it. Chapter Five: The Meaning of Words #Chapter Summary: Words allow us to understand the universe, communicate with each other, and invent things. But it is a mystery how words have this incredible power.\nThere is no resemblance between a word and its referent. The relationship of a word to its referent is indirect. But you cannot understand a word by itself. In order to understand a word, you need to see or know its referent. We use other words to give a word meaning, a definition. But this could be circular reasoning. We need to get to some words that have \u0026ldquo;direct meanings.\u0026rdquo; What is unusual with a word is that when you use it both in written or oral form, it refers to all the samples of its referent in the past, present, and the future. It refers to all its possible uses, both true and false. Behind a word is a concept, a mental picture of what the word represents. This raises new problems because the word refers to both \u0026ldquo;the object\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the concept of that object.\u0026rdquo; The problem with a word\u0026rsquo;s meaning is that it is not located anywhere, not in the word, in the mind, or in the concept. The social phenomenon of language does not fully explain the universal meaning of words. Chapter Six: Free Will #Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of whether or not free will exists, (1) explain what you mean when you say you could have done something other than what you did, and (2) explain what you and the world would have to be like for this to be true.\nDeterminism is the view that existing laws of nature create series of circumstances that make the actions that people take inevitable, ruling out other possibilities. If determinism is true, it implies that people should not be held responsible for their actions, because they did not choose them. Some people argue that even if determinism is true, it is still practical to praise people for doing good and to punish them for doing bad. Some scientists argue that because there\u0026rsquo;s more than one thing an electron may do at any given moment, determinism is false. If determinism is incorrect, then free will definitely exist, and people should be held responsible for their actions. For free will to exist: (1) an actor determined her action by doing it, (2) her action was not determined in advance, (3) her action did not just happen, and (4) she could have done the opposite. Ponder this: You are made up of your desires, beliefs, personality, and the circumstances that created who you are. If an action that you performed is absent of all these forces, could we conclude that \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; really did it? If free will is true and choices are not determined by forces and circumstances within your life, then you could not have done what you did. You could not be held responsible for your actions. If free will exists, then it is plausible that things just happen with no reason. Whether or not determinism is true, it is still plausible that we are not responsible for our actions. If determinism is true, antecedent circumstances are responsible. If determinism is false, nothing is responsible. To claim that the existence of free will implies that things just happen with no reason is meaningless. Free will is just a basic feature of the world and cannot be analyzed. Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s position: If everything that people did was determined then they are essentially trapped. They could not be held responsible for their actions. Chapter Seven: Right and Wrong #Chapter Summary: The biggest problem in ethics and morality is whether or not there is a universal standard for them. Given that humans act according to their motives and that motives are innumerable, a single standard for ethical behavior seems farfetched.\nNot all \u0026ldquo;lawful\u0026rdquo; acts are necessarily \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; acts. Thoughts about the wrongness of certain behaviors are based on a concern to the effect of one\u0026rsquo;s actions on people in general. Ponder this: If you can get what you want by doing something considered to be wrong, why shouldn\u0026rsquo;t you? Most religious motivations to ethical behavior identify something that a person should care about (God), and then connect morality to it. An objection to using God as the ultimate motivation to refrain from doing bad is that even if God exists and forbids what is wrong, his forbidding isn\u0026rsquo;t what makes the act wrong. The act is wrong and that is why God forbids it. There is no substitute for a direct concern for other people as the basis of moral behavior. The problem with morality is that it is supposed to apply to everyone, and yet not everyone has a concern for other people and those who care about other people only care about those they know, not everyone. The universality of morality is questioned when we compare the motives of different individuals and societies at different times. The most radical form of moral relativism claims that the most basic standards of right and wrong depend entirely on the social and cultural conventions. Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s position: Relativism is problematic because it always seems possible to criticize the accepted standards of any society. However, to criticize a society\u0026rsquo;s moral code means to appeal to a more objective standard, which itself is unclear. The most foundational question about morality is how universal and objective it is. The problem with moral arguments is that they appeal to a capacity for impartial motivation which is supposed to be present in all of us but seems deeply buried. It is difficult to justify morality because people have so many motives behind their actions. Chapter Eight: Justice #Chapter Summary: To tackle the problem of inequality and justice, (1) identify which causes of inequalities are morally wrong, and (2) determine which methods of interfering with these inequalities are morally right.\nThere are two kinds of inequalities: one that is deliberately imposed and one that is accidental. Deliberately imposed inequality—like racial and gender discrimination—is self-evidently wrong because the discriminator is doing something wrong. The remedy is simply to prevent it. To analyze whether or not inequalities caused by luck are really wrong is a more difficult philosophical question. Ponder this: \u0026ldquo;Are those people who were born in rich families by luck really at fault to inequalities in a competitive social system? Is it wrong for people to accumulate wealth to better the lives of their families? Is it right to take money away from rich people to give to those who were born in poor families also by luck?\u0026rdquo; Two main sources of accidental inequalities in a competitive social system are: (1) differences in socioeconomic classes into which people are born, and (2) differences in natural abilities and talents. To remedy accidental inequalities caused by differences in socioeconomic classes, either: (1) interfere with the causes or (2) interfere with inequalities directly. Interfering with the causes of accidental inequalities is problematic because these are relatively innocent choices arising from a motive to improve one\u0026rsquo;s state in life. It is easier to interfere with the inequalities directly but doing so does not remove the inequalities permanently. This is usually done by taking money from the rich through various forms of taxation and giving that money to the poor in the form of welfare programs. There is not much we can do to eradicate inequalities based on talent if we do not abolish the competitive social system itself. While this could solve the inequalities, it will incur heavy costs on freedom and efficiency. People who are against redistributive taxation argue that economic transactions that produce inequalities are not inherently wrong and that it isn\u0026rsquo;t right for governments to interfere on people who aren\u0026rsquo;t deliberately hurting anyone. Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s position: Both deliberately imposed and accidental inequalities are unfair. We need redistributive taxation and social welfare programs. The problem of \u0026ldquo;global inequality and justice\u0026rdquo; is problematic just because there is no world government to regulate transactions among nations and such a government would probably be a bad government. Chapter Nine: Death #Chapter Summary: Two important philosophical questions concerning death are: (1) \u0026ldquo;What happens when we die?\u0026rdquo; and (2) \u0026ldquo;Is dying a bad thing or a good thing?\u0026rdquo;\nThe question of survival after death is related to the mind-body problem. For dualists, the soul could exist on its own even without the body so it continues its mental life after death. People who reject the dualist view on death argue that the soul seems to depend entirely on the body for its continued existence. For physicalists, life after death is impossible because physical death means mental death. Thomas Nagel\u0026rsquo;s position: Ordinary observation should be enough to convince us that there is no life after death. Consciousness is intricately dependent on our nervous system. Ponder this: \u0026ldquo;Is your death a good thing or a bad thing? We accept that there was a time before we were born when we didn\u0026rsquo;t yet exist, so why are we bothered about the prospect of not existing again at death?\u0026rdquo; There are three plausible answers to the question above: (1) Death is neutral because nonexistence can\u0026rsquo;t be good or bad; (2) Death is bad because nonexistence is the ultimate evil; and (3) Death is good because it is boring to live forever. Logically, we should only fear death if we will survive it. Chapter Ten: The Meaning of Life #Chapter Summary: For one\u0026rsquo;s life to have meaning, it has to be part of something bigger than itself. But to follow this line of reasoning could lead to the conclusion that life is pointless after all.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t live forever so we can only find the meaning of life within life itself. Ponder this: \u0026ldquo;There are justifications for the little things that we do. But is there really a point in our life as a whole?\u0026rdquo; For our life to have meaning, it has to be part of something larger. But we can ask the question again: \u0026ldquo;What is the meaning of that \u0026rsquo;larger thing?'\u0026rdquo; Some people point to this \u0026rsquo;larger thing\u0026rsquo; as God or another \u0026ldquo;ultimate explanation.\u0026rdquo; But this does not satisfy the questions. Questions about the meaning of the \u0026ldquo;ultimate explanation\u0026rdquo; can continue ad infinitum. This leads to a painful logical conclusion: that life has no meaning after all. Even if life is inherently meaningless, it is still useful to accept the belief that what one does matters.

A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy (Book Summary)"},{"content":"In the past, I immersed myself in many business books. I chose to be a freelancer and freelancing was a pretty scary endeavor. It requires a lot of affirmation, inspiration, and instruction. In hindsight, I think reading a lot of business books while I freelanced was inevitable.\nLooking back at all the business books I read, I realized I wasted a lot of my precious time. Most were really just fluff and their advice often operated on a very shallow understanding of human life and society. In my view, income generation is only a subset of the bigger human pursuit of navigating the material world. And yet, most business books treat income generation as the \u0026ldquo;be all and end all\u0026rdquo; of human existence. People who sincerely want to learn \u0026ldquo;how to make a living\u0026rdquo; would be better off not reading any of these books.\nHaving said this, not all business concepts are useless. As I ventured into my intention to pursue a self-directed study of philosophy this year, I struggled with a particular problem early on that reminded me of a concept I picked up from reading business books. This concept solved my problem and I think it is a useful tool for anyone starting a similar journey in life. In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll share the concept and how I applied it to my problem.\nMetaphysics and Ethics #After reading Square One and familiarizing myself with Steve Patterson\u0026rsquo;s work, I came to this conclusion:\nThere are just so many things I need to learn before I could reach a personally satisfying understanding of the world.\nThis, of course, isn\u0026rsquo;t bad. In fact, it should excite any sincere seeker of truth. And excitement was what I felt after realizing the immensity of thinking that has accumulated for thousands of years about the fundamental questions of reality. However, the realization presented me with an obvious practical problem.\nBefore encountering Patterson\u0026rsquo;s work, I already held beliefs about the world. These beliefs have been with me since what I may call \u0026ldquo;my enlightenment\u0026rdquo; in 2011. While I have not reached an amount of certainty on these beliefs that would push me to commit to them 100%, I have definitely invested my time and emotions \u0026ldquo;acting\u0026rdquo; according to them.\nFor example, for quite some time now, I have held the belief that ultimately there is no skin-encapsulated ego-centric \u0026ldquo;self.\u0026rdquo; Instead, what exists is an \u0026ldquo;interdependent self\u0026rdquo; made up of myself, other humans, animals, plants, and the physical world. This belief, which I now understand as a \u0026ldquo;metaphysical\u0026rdquo; claim about reality, has inspired me to act on a considerable amount of environmentalism in previous years. These actions can be considered derivatives of an \u0026ldquo;ethics\u0026rdquo; (moral principles) inspired by my metaphysical understanding of the world. Early in my philosophical journey, without diving deep on the literature, I felt intuitively that: my metaphysics informs my ethics.\nNow, after meeting Patterson\u0026rsquo;s work, it became clear to me that I have to get deeper on my metaphysical beliefs to check their accuracy. Or more accurately, to check whether or not I am upholding one of my most cherished values: honesty. It became even clearer that this should be an important part of my mission for years to come. I said \u0026ldquo;years\u0026rdquo; because again, there\u0026rsquo;s just too much information to consume!\nThis led me to my major conundrum:\nBecause my metaphysical understanding of the universe ultimately informs my ethical intentions, should I wait for that understanding to be complete and accurate before I act in any personally meaningful, ethical way?\nThis conundrum is based on the worry that if my understanding of the world is flawed, my actions, which are influenced by that understanding, may also be flawed.\n\u0026ldquo;Just Start and Iterate as You Go\u0026rdquo; #While pondering on the questions, I remembered the concept of the \u0026ldquo;minimum viable product\u0026rdquo; (or MVP) popularized by silicon valley entrepreneurs Steve Blank and Eric Ries. The MVP is a product that is intentionally released to the public in its simplest useable form. Releasing a product in this \u0026ldquo;ugly\u0026rdquo; version has two purposes: (1) to test the product\u0026rsquo;s marketability and (2) to lessen costs and risks of monetary loss associated with the project.\nThe idea came out of the more innovative members of the business world—creatives who are bombarded every day with a lot of project ideas and worries on how to start them. The concept of an MVP gave these creatives a framework that encouraged them to \u0026ldquo;just start and iterate as you go.\u0026rdquo; This, my friends, is a good model applicable to any journey one takes in life.\nContemplating the concept of an MVP, I played on the idea of applying it in the philosophical journey I decided to start. I reasoned that there is no way that I could create a personally fulfilling picture of reality, at least at this early point in my journey. While my understanding of the world will take some time to develop, the issues that bother my emotions cannot wait—poverty, violence, the destruction of nature. I have to act according to what I care about right now if I am to contribute to any difference.\nI need to act now according to what I believe is right and make use of whatever amount of metaphysical knowledge I have to inform my actions. Then, like a startup entrepreneur, I will treat my worldview as a minimum viable product—a minimum viable worldview—open to iteration as I go along.\nI would define a minimum viable worldview as a worldview that makes use of whatever one knows about the world right now to inform what one could do right now. It is a worldview that allows one to get out there and do some meaningful work while at the same time learning, absorbing input, and modifying one\u0026rsquo;s worldview as feedback is received.\nHumility and Resoluteness #In my opinion, the minimum viable worldview fosters two values, which I think is essential in any philosophical journey.\nFirst, the minimum viable worldview encourages humility by accepting one\u0026rsquo;s state of uncertainty and ignorance at the beginning of the journey. It brings this even further as one opens oneself to the views of others and the strong possibility of being corrected multiple times.\nDespite this, however, the framework allows one to foster resoluteness—to stand firm on things that one is \u0026ldquo;reasonably certain\u0026rdquo; and convinced about at the \u0026ldquo;present\u0026rdquo; moment. The framework encourages active participation in the most pressing issues of our time despite one\u0026rsquo;s seemingly limited understanding of the world. A person who is strongly called at the moment to contribute to the furthering of the cause need not understand the totality of knowledge. She could act now, and grow along the way.\nI am not sure if I get this one correctly. The framework itself is open to feedback and iteration. But in its current form, I find it meaningful and useful. The framework permits me to continue my environmental activism while I examine the very roots of my beliefs.\n","date":"20 January 2018","permalink":"/essays/minimum-viable-worldview/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"A \"Minimum Viable Worldview\""},{"content":"In Square One, Steve Patterson argues that the three laws of logic—the law of identity, the law of non-contradiction, and the law of the excluded middle—demonstrate that absolute, certain, and objective truths exist. He shows how all arguments against the absoluteness of these laws ultimately fail. Patterson believes that all apparent paradoxes or contradictions are simply linguistic errors. Given their nature, Patterson posits that the laws of logic should be the foundation of any accurate worldview.\nChapter One: Foundations #Chapter Summary: \u0026ldquo;Certain truths exist and they should be used as the foundation for any accurate worldview.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Roots of a Tree #Foundations determine the accuracy of a worldview.\nThe Foundation of a House #It is difficult to change the most fundamental ideas of a worldview.\nRotten Wood #Use skepticism to critically examine and revise your worldview.\nSkepticism #Challenge and doubt every idea you encounter but be open to the possibility that certain truths might exist.\nFrom Top to Bottom #Use “Why?” to get from premises to foundations, where “Why?” no longer applies.\nChapter Two: Implausible and Impossible #Chapter Summary: \u0026ldquo;The central argument for implausibility claims that certainty is beyond the reach of humans.\u0026rdquo;\nTwo Types of Argument #There are two kinds of arguments against certain truths: implausibility (humans can’t access certain truths) and impossibility (certain truth can’t be accessed in principle).\nMistaken Humility #Insisting that all knowledge is uncertain is itself dogmatic.\nNo Land Across the Sea #People who argue that we will never know if certain truths exist have not ventured far enough.\nFaith In Something #A worldview can be rational down to its foundations; faith is unnecessary.\nThe Evolved Brain #The implausibility of accessing certain truths because of the human brain’s limitation does not rule out the possibility that certain truths exist.\nA Senseless Universe #If we can make sense of some parts of the universe, then the universe is comprehensible.\nLanguage Is Imprecise #Communication might be imprecise, but the understanding of concepts can be precise.\nSense-Perception #We can have knowledge that is true regardless of sensory input.\nChapter Three: Logic and Existence #Chapter Summary: “The central argument for implausibility fails because the existence of certain truths can be demonstrated easily.\u0026quot;\nIncreasing Confidence #To understand certain truths, it helps to first analyze the less-than-certain ideas.\nLogic #Logic is the rules of existence: logic is inseparable from existence.\nExistence #There are two kinds of existents: one dependent on our conception (ideas) and another independent of it (things).\nIdentity #Existents follow the law of identity: \u0026ldquo;A is A.\u0026rdquo;\nNon-contradiction #Existents follow the law of non-contradiction: “It is not the case that A and not-A.”\nInseparability #Logic and existence are inseparable: existence cannot occur without identity and non-contradiction.\nTrue or False #Existence is inseparable from logic, and logic is inseparable from truth and falsehood.\nNegation #The law of non-contradiction preserves the meaning of “negation,” which in turn, creates “mutually exclusive” things.\nInescapability #The laws of logic are necessary, universal, and inescapable.

A proposition cannot meaningfully be “half true” therefore something cannot be half-existent. Language could be ambiguous but the world cannot.\nUniversal Flux #The argument that the law of identity does not apply to anything because everything is constantly changing is flawed. Constant change presupposes identity because before something could change it has to have an “identity” where it started. Even if a \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; constantly changes, it is in a particular way at a particular time; this still corresponds to the law of identity.\nEastern Mysticism #Mystical experiences do not prove that real paradoxes exist. The apparent contradiction between reality and the mystic\u0026rsquo;s description of her experience is a reflection of the limitations of language and not of logic. Some knowledge is ineffable. Therefore, grant the importance of mystical experiences but recognize that language might not be able to communicate them precisely.\nQuantum Physics #The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is used to prove the existence of contradictions, is flawed and there are far more superior alternatives.\nThe Unknown World #The argument that we cannot know if the world operates in a fundamentally logical way because we haven’t experienced everything about it, is flawed.

My annual reviews put me in a better position whenever I start a new year. Plus, looking back at the memories I created in the past year is an emotionally fulfilling practice.\nFor my annual review of 2017, I will be following James Clear\u0026rsquo;s simple format. I will be answering three questions:\nWhat went well this year? What didn\u0026rsquo;t go so well this year? What am I working towards? For a twist, I will be applying each of these questions to the three main areas of my life:\nSelf-care Personal transition (to a lifestyle that is less dependent on the market economy and less destructive of the environment) My mission 1. What went well this year? #Self-care # I have maintained my mindfulness practices to a point where I do meditation and yoga every day as long as I am not traveling. I was able to rekindle a few relationships that I thought were already dead. Entering 2017, I made it my intention to fill my life with community. I think I made a good job fulfilling this intention. This year, I made a lot of friends and I was able to connect with several communities: Ginhawa, FLOW, and HEAL. Personal transition # I have deepened my understanding and appreciation of economics. I have started volunteering on a farm where I help in growing vegetables in exchange for food and accommodation. I have also begun to grow my own vegetables at home. My goal is to be food sufficient and resilient in the near future. My mission # This year, I created and launched this new website to house a mission that has become clearer. I also launched a collaborative ebook this year – Tanaw: Eleven Filipino Perspectives On A More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know Is Possible. I returned to freelancing towards the end of the year. This gave me more time to focus on my mission. 2. What didn\u0026rsquo;t go so well this year? #Self-care # I am still on medication throughout this year and I haven\u0026rsquo;t started tapering. I can do a better job of improving my sleep. I still am not eating as healthily as I want to. I have been moving less compared to previous years. Personal transition # It wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the middle of the year when I realized that what I really wanted to do was to \u0026ldquo;transition\u0026rdquo; towards a lifestyle that was easier on the Earth and less dependent on money. My goal entering 2017 was to build a large capital to invest so that I could retire early probably within a five-year period. So early this year, I took on a full-time job which earned me a good sum of money. However, I, later on, realized I didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to be an investor. What I really wanted to do is to master my relationship with the material world through voluntary simplicity and resilience. Like most of my previous years, navigating my relationship with the material world this year was made up of many trials and errors. While I find most of them necessary, I could have made better decisions that would have lessened the difficulties I faced this year. My mission # While I have launched a website and an ebook, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really able to write a lot. I could have created more if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too focused on my personal transition. Now, that I am back to freelancing, I expect that I will be able to study, write, and create more things that I hope people will find helpful. 3. What am I working towards? #Self-care # To be honest, this is an area I haven\u0026rsquo;t completely made up my mind with. What will I be focusing on this 2018 with regards to taking care of myself? Definitely, I intend to continue my mindfulness practices, sleep better, eat better, and move more. I will also be researching the science behind medication tapering so that I could finally come off my medication. Personal transition # I intend to continue pursuing two goals this year: (1) lessen my dependence on money and the market economy and (2) lessen my ecological impact. To lessen my dependence on money, I intend to continue volunteering at the HEAL farm and on other farms around the Philippines. Volunteering on these farms is part of my desire to learn how I can achieve food sufficiency and resilience. I will also be nurturing my relationships with people so that I could rely more on community rather than money. This year, I will be experimenting with a few personal economic practices like income topping, gifting, and non-accumulation. I will be writing more about these practices and my plans for instituting them in my monthly routine in a future article. I also intend to lessen my ecological impact by traveling less, especially by plane, and by changing several habits that I have, which contribute to the destruction of Gaia. My mission # After encountering Steve Patterson\u0026rsquo;s work, I intend to focus on studying logic and philosophy. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about using whatever I learn to check the foundations of the beliefs and concepts that I held on after leaving my childhood religion in 2012. I know that this intention will lead me to different places so I\u0026rsquo;m not setting a lot of expectations and goals on my mission this year. I\u0026rsquo;ll just begin and see where it brings me. While I\u0026rsquo;ll be focusing on personal study, I do intend to write more this year and populate this website with articles and other instructive content. It will be part of my learning journey this 2018.

It was like creating a mini-history book of my life in 2016. The latter parts of this year were still fresh in my memory but it was the earlier months of this year, which I needed to really review.\nLike the historiographic projects I used to do back in college, my review of the past year involved organizing my photographs and using them to fill in the gaps of my story. I shared a few of them below. I also needed to reread my journal entries—intimate and more than truthful primary sources—to look at specific patterns of thinking that emerged throughout last year. Overall, the process was a cathartic, deeply spiritual experience, which provided valuable insights on how I evolved and changed last year and how I might thrive in this new year.\nLooking back, I think 2016 was the year I really developed a deeper understanding and reluctant appreciation of the market economy. Throughout the year I confronted the issues of death, environmental degradation, vocation, poverty, and the violent \u0026ldquo;unconscious\u0026rdquo; economy. Ironically, as I progressed in my understanding of the material world, I went deeper into my spiritual journey and grew into trusting the things that we don\u0026rsquo;t see more and more—love, peace, camaraderie—as the sole refuge to what could be a harsh universe.\nMy 2016 Timeline #January # I began my year by reading the Bhagavad Gita, and I immediately fell in love with the yogic philosophy, especially the concept of \u0026ldquo;conscious movement.\u0026rdquo; The book inspired me to live my 2016 in a similar fashion—to pursue goals mindfully and to strike a balance between walking towards the future and living in the moment. I wrote my intentions in a post entitled How to Live Your 2016? Move Consciously. Most of the goals I set at the beginning of the year were never achieved. But that is the true meaning of the philosophy: to let life surprise you and forget of a plan altogether. I received a full scholarship from the Australian company Earth HQ for the first run of their Soulpreneurs Program. It was a seminal experience, one which was vital in encouraging me to continue with my indie career aspirations. Yvette Luciano, the founder of the online holistic entrepreneurship training was a kind, vibrant, and generous teacher who believed in my potential to succeed in the space. At the end of the month, I visited Urbiztondo Beach at San Juan, La Union, and Tangadan Falls at San Gabriel. February # This month, I saw more of La Union when I visited the Bahay na Bato (House of Stone) at Bangar. For the first time, I experienced an hour of coaching with Dindin Reyes. It was an experience that really forced me to look at a few plain truths: I am craving for real community and I might have to give more attention to how I\u0026rsquo;m healing my old wounds. The climax of this month was my three-day yoga retreat at beautiful Palaui. More than the alluring sea and landscape, it was the opportunity to practice yoga with really friendly and interesting people, which made the experience something I will never forget. I think I need to go back there this 2017. March # This month was spent immersing myself in the Soulpreneurs Program and integrating my realizations from the yoga retreat. My biggest take-away from the Soulpreneur course so far was: \u0026ldquo;I am not here to heal the world but to heal myself so that by doing so I might heal the world.\u0026rdquo; One of the most important realizations that came to me this month was a clearer vision of an ideal life I wanted to create. What I really wanted was a simple combination of spirituality, communion with Nature, reading, writing, intimate conversations with people, a source of income that provides \u0026ldquo;just enough,\u0026rdquo; and personal space, an environment that supports all that. Ten months after this insight, I still hold this vision. One of the most awe-inspiring moments of my 2016 was seeing a pawikan (sea turtle) hatch from its egg and slowly gained strength as it breathed the sea. We helped the little creatures start their voyage at sea hoping they\u0026rsquo;ll come back after many years to repopulate their already endangered race. April # This month, I signed contracts for two major academic writing projects from my biggest client so far. I projected that what I’ll earn from these two projects would be enough to cover my expenses for the entire year and, given my frugal lifestyle, perhaps even more. I was extremely grateful for the referral. Because of it, I was able to drop lower-paying gigs. A few thoughts I had this month which left me awestruck as I review my journal right now: This month I was philosophizing about the benefits of keeping our passions devoid of monetary value. I realized that what I really wanted was to just do what I was doing and not to sell it, not to make money out of my art. Perhaps, this was an important realization that would, later on, convince me about the limitations that capitalism has brought twenty-first-century creative life. Also, I was thinking about the possibility of being more scholarly in my writing and the benefits of relocating. This month, I spent a night at the Talisayen Cove at San Antonio, Zambales. I tried hiking the nearby mountain that housed a grotto but wasn’t able to finish because of the heat and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to bring water. I\u0026rsquo;m coming back to this place and probably do the hike again. This month, I also hiked Mt. Gulugod Baboy at Batangas, which astonished me with the best seascape I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen in my life. Thank you so much Mother Earth. May # At the end of April, I felt a little burnt out from the two projects I was working on. The beginning of May was a time for me to get back to my center—to connect with my Inner Self by engaging in mindfulness practices and creative projects and to revisit my life design and goals in general. As part of this return to the center, I visited Bolinao again after a long time. The trip was invigorating but I was also deeply saddened after seeing how tourism has destroyed this once pristine haven. June # Picking up from my spiritual journey in May, June was a big month for me in terms of rethinking the issue of vocation. To help me, I began delving deeper into the works of Parker Palmer, an activist and Quaker writer. This month, I read his books Let Your Life Speak (on vocation) and A Hidden Wholeness (on community). July # This month, I finished reading two of the works of Dr. Robert Lanza, Biocentrism and Beyond Biocentrism, as I tackled the interconnections of science and spirituality. It was one of the most mind-blowing reading experiences I have ever had. Dr. Lanza\u0026rsquo;s work will prove useful to me at the end of this month and throughout 2016 as I experienced several encounters with death. Dr. Lanza is one of those scientists who use science to interpret phenomena that are at the core of being alive, one of which is the implications of a universe with no time to our understanding of death and the afterlife. I continued to reflect on the issue of my personal vocation during this month while I enjoyed a creative splurge at the same time. My imagination was invigorated. At the end of the month, I visited the National Museum in Manila for the very first time. I still can\u0026rsquo;t believe I graduated with a Major in History without seeing this. August # This month, I picked up the book Creating a Life Worth Living by Carol Lloyd. I deeply enjoyed her practical and realistic approach to building a creative lifestyle and career. After reading the creative archetypes she presented in her book, it became clearer to me that I have this constant, ever present dichotomy within me—I was a creative who both relied heavily on my intellect to produce work (Thinker) while at same time tapped into that part of me that escapes thoughts for rest, healing, and purpose (Mystic). This month, I also began to welcome the thought of relocating (again). Although living in San Jacinto provides me with a simple lifestyle that allows for less work and more time for creative and intellectual pursuits, my need for community and connection with like-minded people has been a big problem for me for a long time already. It\u0026rsquo;s something that relocating might solve. I took my biggest trip of the year this month, flying to the humble yet captivating town of Coron in Palawan. September # A year has passed after I left my independent contractor job at a research team at the University of the Philippines Emerging Interdisciplinary Studies (UP-EIDR) after which I started an independent consulting writing practice. I confronted the data from my financial review and reassessed my feelings about what I was doing. My first year as a freelance writer and editor was a roller coaster ride of income and emotions something I expressed in my post that month, Maybe You Are Fighting More Battles Than You Can Handle. This year, I intended to build a strong foundation for my creative career by focusing on financial management. However, due to the facts that have now been revealed, I shifted my attention from wanting to understand how to be a better freelancer to wanting to understand money, the larger economy, and my place in the capitalist system. To start this project, I started reading two books. The first book was The Last Safe Investment by Bryan Franklin and Michael Ellsberg, which presented a radical suggestion by saying that we should spend what we earn on things that will make us happier and increase our earning potential. It radically interpreted investment as not just a matter of finances. It connected the intangible aspects of life with material wealth and considered \u0026ldquo;expenses\u0026rdquo; on health, well-being, and happiness as actual \u0026ldquo;investments.\u0026rdquo; It was nice and was a fresh breath of air from the more conservative book I finished reading earlier this year: Your Money or Your Life by Vicki Robin, Joe Dominguez, and Monique Tilford. However, something else was lacking from The Last Safe Investment. I am thrifty and the book didn’t really advocate thrift. The second book I read filled this gap. I began reading Early Retirement Extreme (a really bad title for an otherwise epic book) by Jacob Lund Fisker. For the first time, I saw a book that advocated less dependence on the market economy as a tool for lessening hours and years at paid employment (read: early retirement). I never thought of paid work that way before so that bird’s eye view realization was really enlightening. By this book, I thought I found the answer to my problem (which was simply to keep doing what I was already doing—living a simple life). However, Jacob’s process involved investing, a skill that is complex and can be quite devoid of ethics and social responsibility. Of course, Jacob\u0026rsquo;s uber-minimalist lifestyle when adapted by multiple people can be a big contribution to the alleviation of environmental, moral, and cultural degradation caused by over consumerism. However, there must be a better book, a better way of thinking—one that inherently connects our relationship with money and our desire for a better world. Fortunately, Jacob’s book pointed me to another inspiring work which bridged the gap between the pursuit of individual freedom through simple living and the social relevance of such a lifestyle. October # I received a response to an email I sent a few months ago. It was from a client looking for writers for an academic general reference book series. I was accepted to contribute and I got a new gig. It was less lucrative than the first one but more exciting. I started missing school and the academe while doing the research. For a while, I thought about going back to school and getting a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree but my inner radical won’t let me. I\u0026rsquo;ll be reading Self-University by Charles Hayes this 2017 to enlighten me more on the subject of unschooling and self-education. Jacob Lund Fisker’s book pointed me to William Coperthwaite’s only book entitled A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity. It was a refreshing read. For the first time, I was exposed to a person who lived a life of voluntary simplicity and principled living, who bridged the gap between lifestyle and social change. Who would’ve thought that living with no running water and electricity can, by itself, be a form of civil disobedience? I am captivated by this hero’s life. Count me a follower. William Coperthwaite would open the doors for a new way of principled living I have very little idea about: homesteading. Like a lot of things in my life, the answer to many of my questions about money, work, and career was already under my nose. I am living in a farming community and yet I have never realized how important our relationship to the land is to our opportunity to enjoy freedom while contributing to healing the world at the same time. November # The general reference writing project was cancelled. Although, we were compensated in full, this left me heartbroken because my work won’t get published. Nevertheless, this gave me enough time to think more about my relationship with money and the work that I am meant to do. As a continuation of my education on money and economics, I finished reading Saved by Ben Hewitt. I understood more about the social construction of money and was excited to learn more so I began researching. Through Ben, I began to seriously consider farming and homesteading as part of the life work I want to build (now if only I could get a hand on a piece of land). What’s great about Ben is, unlike William Coperthwaite, he’s still alive and he can respond to an email once I decide to send one. This month, apart from my self-education projects, I camped and hiked at Mt. Balungao, Pangasinan. I also attended my very first two and a half-day sesshin, an intensive meditation retreat in the tradition of Zen Buddhism. It was difficult but enlightening. I met really awesome people after the closing ceremony, which was really the only time we got to talk to each other. December # This month, I received my first technical copyediting assignment from the same company that offered the general reference series project. I was grateful that they saw my diligence in my previous job and were interested in working with me longer. The new project was a lengthy 13 chapters of a book on teaching sociology. Although I made a lot of mistakes (credit to my client for giving me a chance on something I have very little experience with), I learned a lot about the book publishing process just by doing this project. I received another project this January 2017 on a book about values-driven organizations. I attempted to relocate to Sta. Barbara but changed my mind. I’ve decided to stay in San Jacinto until I have decided what to do next. I began to give serious thought to the side effects of the meds I am taking to put my depression at bay. So, I visited INAM, a year after I left the research team associated with the organization, to consult about a transition to medicine-less treatment. The doctor prescribed me anthroposophic medicines but the inner radical in me and my newly acquired decision-making skills made me thought well about the matter before committing to any medical program. This will be an important personal project for me in 2017. I finished reading Smart Choices and am looking forward to applying the process in my decision opportunities this 2017. What Went Well #This was a great year for me business-wise. Despite it being my first year as a real full-time freelancer, I was able to drop low-paying gigs for two high-level clients, one of which I think I’ll be keeping for a little while longer. The money I made was enough given my very minimalist lifestyle and for it I am grateful.\nThis was also the year I developed a more mature and conscious relationship with money. I spent more than half of the year building a foundation for my freelance writing/editing practice. Contrary to what most people think, freelancing is more difficult than traditional employment simply because a freelancer needs to handle most of the technical work, which employers handle for employees. The biggest challenge for me early on was keeping track of my earnings and managing my finances altogether. However, by September when I confronted the data from my first business year and a major project was canceled, I started to question what I was doing and spent most of October thinking about my general philosophy on money and making a living.\nThe inner philosopher in me has unleashed again and I started to ask questions like: What is money? Why does it even exist? Thankfully, I asked the right questions as these lead me to an important turning point in my intellectual maturity. I would say, my biggest achievement this year was my heightened awareness and consciousness on the subtle power of money and the importance of limiting my dependence on the market economy and helping our society’s transition towards a more nonviolent, environmentally-sound, and conscious economy.\nWhat Went Wrong #As I mentioned above, although this was a great year for me professionally and financially, I experienced a period of doubt on whether to continue freelancing particularly in September when I hit the end of my first business year (because I started freelancing full-time in September 2015). This year, I experienced the loss of a few really promising clients, I experienced a few delayed payments, and there were big projects that never materialized. In November, my first project with a foreign client was canceled. Although I was paid the entire amount, the general reference articles I wrote were not to be published. All of these greatly affected my confidence in what I was doing. I realized I could do better in terms of building my brand as a writer/editor and that is inevitable if I want to continue working in a competitive marketplace.\nThis year, I experienced a lot of confrontation with death. In July our family lost Helene, in August two of our most cherished dogs—Kara and Bubbles—bade farewell. They were with me during the most difficult time of my life and that hurt me more than anything. The Philippines also saw an increase of people being killed due to the war on drugs, one of which I myself saw near our neighborhood during a morning bike ride. Although these experiences are disheartening, they taught me a lot about coping with grief and developing acceptance of what is.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m Looking Forward To This 2017 #While I\u0026rsquo;m open to anything that could happen in 2017, I\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to integrating all the important lessons I learned last year into making a big life and career pivot this year. My need for community is something I was not able to fully address last year despite the many interesting people I\u0026rsquo;ve met. I need to be close to where I belong if I want to thrive in the vocation I will commit myself so a relocation might be an important decision I have to make and implement this in 2017. Life is all about relationships after all and the healthiest, happiest people are those who are surrounded by the right people.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to a community-filled 2017!\n","date":"7 January 2017","permalink":"/essays/2016-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2016 Annual Review: A Growing Understanding Of The Unconscious Economy"},{"content":"Looking back on 2015, I would say this was my year of deeper understanding about who I really am and what I want to do next with my life.\nTo put my 2015 in perspective I\u0026rsquo;ll align it with what I think my previous years\u0026rsquo; themes were. I\u0026rsquo;ll start with 2011 because it was just a pivotal year for me.\n2011 - Awakening\n2012 - Renaissance\n2013 - Freedom\n2014 - Movement-Stasis-Containment\n2015 - Self\n(*Note: Since I am writing this spontaneously, I want to keep note of what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling along the way. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m stuck with 2014. I just realized, 2014 was a difficult year to look back to. Maybe I was not able to reflect well on this, that\u0026rsquo;s why. I can\u0026rsquo;t nail it with one word. I\u0026rsquo;m putting \u0026ldquo;Stasis-Movement-Containment\u0026rdquo; to signify how I look at it today. Explanation below. It\u0026rsquo;s significant for me because it sparked what I would say my best year ever since 2011 - this year, 2015.)\nSince I am a historian by training, allow me to do a timeline. Quite structured, quite systematic, and scientific, I know, but it\u0026rsquo;s just how my mind works.\nFirst, how my 2014 sparked my 2015.\nPre-2015 #2014 was a year of movement. I launched this blog I was thinking about since finishing my undergrad in 2013. My dreams for the blog were two-fold (sometimes conflicting). I wanted to make a lifestyle business out of it but at the same time, I wanted it to represent who I really was, to express myself, and to change my life through it. Obviously, this leads me to a lot of adventures. Post after post, then a mini-book, then a few followers, etc. Launching and maintaining the platform for a few months became my life and I enjoyed it a lot.\nThen came a very pivotal struggle with my environment and my daily life in general. I was \u0026ldquo;moving\u0026rdquo; with my dream of being a writer/online entrepreneur but at the same time I felt \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;contained.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;contained\u0026rdquo; because the process—my days, my weeks, my life in general—began to feel like a never-ending cycle of habits. Was this what working for myself looks like? Well, I realized, I was following the wrong advice, and that caused the suffering. Coupled with this feeling was the frustration that my environment was no longer serving my true and creative self. The neighborhood and the people around me were no longer making my inner life healthy. I had to leave. At least for a while.\nSo that sparked my 2015, my best year ever so far. And here it goes.\n2015: A Year in Review #January #With money enough to support me for a month or two I embarked on a quest for life at Metro Manila—no plans whatsoever, I just wanted to leave home. I started to try freelancing but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work out so well so I realized I needed a day job to support me if I wanted to stay longer in my new home. I applied for two jobs and waited. Afraid that my money would be completely depleted before even getting a job, I decided to go home for a few weeks.\nFebruary #I was accepted as a Research Assistant at the University of the Philippines. The pay was good, the work was no hassle (not yet), and I had enough time to pursue my other interests and side projects. I immediately invested in a beautiful place to stay in—a spare room at a house within a subdivision, a quiet haven in the middle of a busy metropolitan.\nMarch #I have to go back home again as our salaries were delayed. Because I was working for research funded by the government, I later realized I have to learn to cope with these possible delays in salaries. Good things definitely come with a price.\nApril #Summer. So hot. So humid. This is tropical life! I had to get back to Manila as salaries were released and work resumed.\nMay #Relatives from the United States returned for a month-long family reunion. I was not able to join them in every activity they set but I was there most of the time. The flexible job schedule made that possible. Overall, this month was a break from the challenges that came the months before. For the first time in a long time, I felt I was living the life I wanted.\nJune #I began investing time on my personal development again. Feeling grounded at my new environment and having had done what I had to do to sustain my lifestyle, I was ready to focus on taking care of myself again. Interestingly, the more I tried to take good care of my body and mind, the more I got sick. Rainy days came, I caught cold, never-ending headaches, and extra-extra weight. Hm\u0026hellip;weird. The best part of June however was my first trip to the beautiful city (within a forest) of Puerto Princesa, Palawan.\nJuly #July was the month that everything I never expected just happened. My health went spiraling down, my troubles with anxiety enveloped my days with no noticeable reasons, work began to feel a lot like \u0026ldquo;work,\u0026rdquo; and a working trip that finally made me realize how much I missed freedom. With just around 6 months in the job I thought I will be keeping for a long time, I resigned.\nAugust #I got back home teary-eyed, embarrassed. But my family, my father specifically, talked me out of the embarrassment. He said he missed me while I was gone and that he wanted me to be around. So, I decided to keep my life a little simpler, back home, back to doing freelance work, back to serving my soul, back to serving my passions, back to serving others. I launched a new mini-book and earned my first dollars/pesos from it. I was very happy.\nSeptember #I noticed that during the entire month of August I was doing, doing, doing\u0026hellip;creating, creating, creating\u0026hellip;ah! the freedom!\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t have this for over six months and I was so excited to get back to creating that my drive was so strong\u0026hellip;and then\u0026hellip;it suddenly vanished! September was about slowing down, reflecting on what to do next in life. Ironically, it began my eventual descent into full-time freelance writing. I am forever grateful to the universe for providing me clients in my first month as a serious freelancer. But more importantly, September started the transformation of my relationship with writing, care of, The Literati Writers.\nOctober #As I was slowly seeing the value of transforming my relationship with writing into a more healthy practice, I simultaneously began developing a strong thirst for all things spiritual..again. I began going back to the feelings associated with my history of Christian work as an ex-young pastor and realized that I was not really an atheist or disbeliever or Darwinist or Marxist—I was a spiritual junkie, always was, unable to detach myself from the sublime soulful vessel that I am. That was the biggest revelation I had for a long time—the biggest achievement of my 2015! I began reading, studying, and reflecting on Eastern philosophical texts and began calling myself a \u0026ldquo;lightworker.\u0026rdquo;\nNovember #As the year is slowly coming to a close, I began to see clearer and clearer, who I truly am and the path that I am about to walk through in the coming months. I had glimpses of ideas—creative, professional, and personal but I was generally lacking the drive to live again. Here I was back to feelings of stasis and containment. Realizing that this is temporary and that unlike before I don\u0026rsquo;t have to go through a drastic life change to feel \u0026ldquo;movement,\u0026rdquo; I embarked on two weeks of continuous travel and reconnecting with people. I went to Baguio City to see my sister, to visit a friend who was about to give birth, and to meet an Indian monk who talked to me about yoga, vegetarianism, and meditation. Then, I went to Baler, Aurora to surf and see the beautiful Dicasalarin Cove atop a lighthouse for a few days.\nDada (\u0026ldquo;brother\u0026rdquo;) doing his afternoon meditation while he fed me fried mongo seeds and other vegetarian foods.\nWith my fried Aina a month before she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl she named Hiraya, a Filipino word which means \u0026ldquo;imagination\u0026rdquo;.\nDicasalarin Cove atop the Lighthouse at Baler, Aurora\nDecember #December was a month of \u0026ldquo;growth\u0026rdquo; for me professionally. Not \u0026ldquo;growth\u0026rdquo; as in making more money but growth in the sense that I am slowly understanding how I can make this freelance journey more soul-nourishing. I had to let go of some clients who were just not the right fit for me and instead focused on looking for people with whom I feel comfortable working with. This process involved getting crystal clear on the qualities of clients I am looking for and sticking to work with those people and only them. Spiritual-wise, I\u0026rsquo;m currently dwelling on the idea of the \u0026ldquo;divine in the ordinary\u0026rdquo; and more radical applications of \u0026ldquo;living in the present moment.\u0026rdquo; Honestly, this is quite a challenge as I have a strong drive to do, do, and do as any creative would confess. I recently climbed a mountain a day after Christmas. After that the journey is unknown and I like it that way.\nBefore climbing the summit of Mt. Pico de Loro at Ternate, Cavite.\nTo conclude this rather long piece, I would say that 2015 was really the year I listened intently to the true \u0026ldquo;Self\u0026rdquo; within me, within every one of us, within the very universe we say we live in. It was a year that I think I began my path towards self-realization, towards accepting my real identity as a spiritual person of a more rebellious kind.\nWhile previous years were about getting back on track after what I went through in 2011, this year, this 2015, was different, because I really felt I was walking towards a higher realm. I was no longer just surviving or just recovering. I was already, despite seemingly tiny steps, flourishing! And I love this! Really, I love this! Just typing these words make me feel so good and proud about what my 2015 has become.\nHonoring the Self. Serving others through the Self. Getting crystal clear of what you want. Moving. Connecting. Then stopping to just \u0026ldquo;be.\u0026rdquo; Then moving again. These are things I experience during this year. These are the things I want more out of 2016 and all the years to come!\nDear friend, you, the reader who cares about what I have to say, enough to read my story, my life, what happened to me as I traverse my own journey, I wish you a good year to come. May your path be filled the things you want more out of life! Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n","date":"7 January 2016","permalink":"/essays/2015-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2015 Annual Review: Stasis, Movement, and the Unveiling of the \"Self\""},{"content":"As 2014 is bidding farewell, the blogosphere is filled with people making their annual reviews. Among the many reviews I was able to read were those of Leo Babauta, Chris Guillebeau, and Scott Dinsmore.\nIn simple terms, an annual review is a practice done usually at the end of the year, which aims to look at the different things that transpired in one\u0026rsquo;s life over the course of an entire year. The review consists of three parts:\nWhat went well throughout the year? What went wrong throughout the year? What will the coming year look like? Guide For Your Annual Review #There are several awesome guides that could help you write your own annual review but for me, only two were really notable.\nFirst is Chris Guillebeau\u0026rsquo;s process. What he does is that at the end of the year, he withdraws in a cabin in the woods for a week and does his annual review using a fairly simple template in the form of a spreadsheet and which he makes available for download at his site.\nIf you are interested, check out the template here as well as his really interesting annual review for 2014 here. Chris is really an achieved person. Having published several New York Times bestsellers, I think his annual review is worth checking out.\nThe best template for me I think is Scott Dinsmore\u0026rsquo;s free workbook. Aside from the usual successes and failures roundup, he really guides you throughout goal-setting and weekly planning, which shows you how dedicated Scott really is in terms of the actual realization of your dreams and aspirations. I used it for doing my own annual review and I highly recommend his workbook. Get the free PDF files here.\nWhat Went Well In 2014 #Now, I would like to share to you the results of my own Annual Review of 2014.\nHere is a list of the things that went well in my year.\nI discovered I was a polymath. I started Philippine Disability History. I lost weight. I graduated (finally). I discovered lifestyle design. I discovered the blogosphere. I learned a lot about the real me. I got my first entrepreneurial gig as a writer and archivist. I was able to survive as a freelancer for one year. I launched a website and became a real blogger. I launched a free eBook. I deepened and rejuvenated several key relationships. I found my spirituality again. I worked at my first full-time job. I experienced living inside UP Diliman and at Metro Manila for one month. I saw Bulusan lake. I was able to pay for my own meds. I was able to join Fizzle for free, trained, and made new friends online. What Went Wrong In 2014? #With all the successes I had the past year, here are their negative counterparts. Many of these were not necessarily bad. The truth is that the biggest failures we have are actually also our biggest successes because they ultimately point us in the right direction.\nHere are my failures throughout the year and I\u0026rsquo;m happy I had them.\nI feel some regret for not pursuing some available jobs. I thought I could live in Manila with very little cash but I was wrong. I was not able to control my anger and I waged war with my neighbors which made them very defensive and which makes it difficult to talk peace with them today. I failed to maintain my lifestyle and I have to move out of the house and the town because situations were getting worse. I failed with creating a good blog many times because I did not know what I was doing and I just experimented along the way. I assumed that starting a business was easy but it was way more difficult. I failed in building a really quality relationship with my girlfriend. I failed in building deeper relationships with my family, relatives, and friends. I was not able to surround myself with the right people. I was not able to build a mastermind group who would support me as I pursue my dreams and goals. I was not able to build any savings. I was not able to pay for my monthly health insurance regularly. I did not achieve any financial goals this year. My physical and mental health was poor the majority of the year. I was not able to make significant progress in some passions and skills I wanted to develop. What 2015 Would Look Like For Me #Now given all these things that went wrong this 2014, how would I want to improve?\nHere are the specific areas I wanted to put my attention on as well as goals that correspond with them.\nAreas of Attention #Health # Mental Health Physical Health Environment Relationships Spirituality Money # Source of Monthly Income Insurance Savings Financial Goal Passion # Blogging Goals #Mental Health #Sleep: Develop good sleeping habits for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit).\nLaptop: Decrease exposure to my laptop for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit).\nIrritability: Manage anger and irritability for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit).\nRelationships: Develop deep and healthy relationships with several key people in my life for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit).\nMindfulness: Follow the Mindfulness Program for 2 months and see what happens.\nYoga: Practice Yoga for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit).\nPhysical Health # Eating Habits: Develop good eating habits for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit). Exercise: Do cardio exercise 30 minutes every day for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit). Increase Physical Activity: Gradually increase the baseline 30 minutes of exercise every day until I develop a habit of one hour every day for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit). Decrease Food Intake: Decrease food intake for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit). Lose Weight: Increase physical activity while decreasing food intake for two months (with the goal of continuing the habit). Environment # I want to create a relatively peaceful, calmer, cleaner, and natural environment. Relationships # I want to be surrounded by the right people + create a mastermind group. Spirituality # I want to learn Buddhism and practice Yoga. Work # I want to find a job that I will learn to love and that I could keep until I can start a business of my own. Insurance # Allot a specific amount of money every month for health insurance, etc. Savings # Save a specific amount of money every month for unforeseen emergencies and opportunities. Online Business # Save and spend a specific amount of money for starting and developing an online business. Goodbye 2014 #So that\u0026rsquo;s it for my year. Setting goals and achieving them are two different things and I hope that I could really set myself up to the challenge of doing all these things I laid in front of me.\nHow about you?\nHow will you say goodbye to 2014?\n","date":"8 January 2015","permalink":"/essays/2014-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2014 Annual Review"},{"content":"October 2014.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s amazing how fast time goes by. It has been a year since the end of my last semester in college, a year after I decided to sit back and think about what to do with my life, a year since I chose to live in freedom more than anything else.\nMost college students nearing the end of their university life know exactly what to do next. That\u0026rsquo;s the reason why people go to college anyway. The choice of degree is expected to predetermine the choice of work. If you are not me then you have probably figured everything out. You know exactly what to do next after you step out of college.\nBut I am not that kind of person. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be that kind of person.\nIf you are like me on this matter rest assured that I have your back.\nIn this week\u0026rsquo;s post, I would like to share with you the half-review of my past year. I tried to write everything in a single article but the post became so lengthy. So I decided that it would be better for the other half to be featured in the next post.\nI know 2014 has not ended yet. But for me, the journey I had since the beginning of this year has pretty much ended. I am ready to close this chapter of my life and figure out what to do next. I am ready to set bigger goals—goals that will declare the person in me.\nFrom my story I hope that you would be inspired to do one thing.\nTake risks.\nConsider this article a permission for you to do so.\nWhen I did the bizarre things I never thought I would do in the past year, no one gave me permission to do so other than my self. Because of that I felt frightened and dislocated sometimes.\nBut you don\u0026rsquo;t have to go through the same thing I went through. I offer my hand to you as you leap into the unknown, as you confront your fears and trust in faith. I am here, so don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid. Many people have done it before. There is practically no reason for you not to do so.\nSo take risks and have faith. Believe me. The worst never happens.\nThe Hundred-paged Document that Nobody Read (October 2013) #The bulk of this month was spent finishing a thick thesis that didn\u0026rsquo;t resonate much with my definition of fun.\nIn my last semester in college, I began to feel dislocated from university life in general. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stay in that place any longer—a place where everything you have to put in your brain is determined by a bigger authority.\nAt the end of my college life, I had only two subjects left—one I thought I liked (Thesis Writing) and one I totally didn\u0026rsquo;t like (Spanish).\nIt is not that I disliked learning. I am an extremely voracious consumer of knowledge. But the university setup is something I think I won\u0026rsquo;t thrive in, at least not anymore. This is a realization that hit me just of late after reading Chris Gullibeau and Scott Dinsmore.\nThe university, like the church, is still a hierarchy no matter how secular it is and no matter how liberal its education system is. I think my university has honored a lot of rights but I was yearning for more.\nI want to be entitled to the right to determine what to put inside my head every single day.\nAlthough this was still a vague idea back in October 2013, every single sensation that my body gave me as I wrote a hundred-paged document that no one actually read, not even me, was to finish school as fast as I can and just move on.\nI finished and bounded the damn thesis, which my adviser thought was great.\nWhat she didn\u0026rsquo;t know was that I procrastinated a lot before I finished the job and that I left college with no soul left in me.\nLost Again (November 2013) #After leaving college, I went with my aunt and my cousin\u0026rsquo;s family to Southern Luzon to visit Legazpi City and Hacienda Escudero. This trip was enough to relieve me of all the stress of thesis writing and I got back home with the intention of reflecting on what to do next with my life.\nThe first thing I did was to read a book on career planning. But before I did that, I had a very small idea of what kind of job I would want to do. I thought anything related to some work I did in the past will do as a career. Back then I did not realize how big a concept \u0026ldquo;career\u0026rdquo; was. I did not know how different it was from work, passion, dreams, and goals. I thought if I chose one of the four kinds of jobs I preferred back then—academe, social development, disability work, or special/inclusive education—I\u0026rsquo;ll have to do that and be proficient with that for the rest of my life.\nReading the career planning book was quite helpful in reviewing my previous life interests but I was still practically disabled.\nI did not know what to do with my life.\nBread and Butter (December 2013) #As I was thinking about the \u0026ldquo;career\u0026rdquo; I would pursue, a job was actually offered to me by the institution that was the subject matter of my thesis—The Philippine Mental Health Association Baguio-Benguet Chapter. I was asked if I could continue writing their history to cover the years not included in my study, 1974 to 2013. Little did I knew that this would be my first real entrepreneurial venture.\nBut the go signal for starting the project came at a later time. I was excited about the project but I also have to earn money sooner so with the suggestion of my aunt, I applied as an E-Learning Professional for an Online English School for Japanese students. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I planned for this. I never wanted to teach English. But I was lost and uncertain so I needed time to think while earning a good enough amount of money to pay for my monthly bills.\nThe work was so flexible, I did my personal projects in the morning while I worked in the evening. Although it was not ideal, this job provided me enough income to support myself while introspecting about my North Star—the life I was meant to live.\nFurthermore, because of this \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; bread-and-butter job I was able to launch this website and write again. I was able to rejuvenate my passion for reading and learning, something that really challenged me a lot in college and thus affected my grades.\nToday, I am in the process of monetizing my passion for writing and self-improvement but until I get into that, I think this source of income pretty fits me well.\nInto the Academe, Or Not (January 2014) #By this time, I was already exploring the possibility of blogging but my efforts were quite scattered and misdirected.\nI was really thinking about venturing into the academe because it is the most logical and immediate answer to my dilemma. I pretty much know what academic life is, I had lived it for four and a half years. I had a good foundation in research and I was actually invited by one of my professors to try to apply to our university. In addition, I had this belief that the academe actually holds the solution to the problems of my country. Being an activist back in college, the prospect of using knowledge to change the world through the academic system sounded enticing.\nI also had a strong passion for starting a whole new body of venture research on the history of disability in the Philippines. I started a blog and opened a Facebook fan page on the subject where I published some of my research findings calling the whole idea, Philippine Disability History.\nAt this time, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any knowledge or background in blogging and social media. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any competitive idea about leveraging the power of the internet to amplify one\u0026rsquo;s voice and be heard by other people. All I knew was I cared and I wanted to start something and probably inspire others to do so.\nI am still quite amazed with the influence of this amateur venture research. Through the blog and the Facebook fan page, I was able to connect with interest groups from all over the world as well as individual advocates. They sent messages and shared some of my posts. I did not expect that through this blog I would be connected with a researcher of a similar interest who works as an instructor in the College of Saint Benilde in De La Salle University.\nThat is the power of blogging. It builds relationships and allows the meekest of the meek to be heard and inspire others to take action.\nToday, I had slowed down with this research venture. It has been months since I last read a history book. But I do hope that in the coming months, I would find time to water this passion again and maybe continue the journey as an Independent Researcher.\nThe Voice Shouting Inside Me (February 2014) #By this month, I think I was really focused on finding a job. I was being inpatient about waiting for the PMHA to send me the signal to start the history and archiving project and as it has always been my nature, I started to feel a little tired with teaching English. I wanted to do something else.\nSo after three months of finishing my college life, I finally decided to look for a job.\nBeing the lazy cautious type of person that I am, I decided to plan out my job search strategy before venturing into the hustle. So I read the Two-Hour Job Search by Steve Dalton and applied his intuitive method.\nI think Steve\u0026rsquo;s idea was very interesting and insightful. But after investing a lot of time reading his book and figuring out how to apply his methodology, two job openings emerged in front of me, which removed the need to search for more.\nThere was a vacant position at a nearby International School which needed a Middle School Social Studies Teacher. I was short-listed and was invited for an interview. The school principal wanted graduates from the University of the Philippines and the probability of my being hired was quite high.\nAt almost the same time, the University of the Philippines Los Baños was hiring instructors for its Social Science department and a very close instructor of mine was actually offering a hand to help me land a position.\nThose were terribly sleepless nights.\nThere I was, emerging from a one-year depressive episode, lost and left with no soul after a crushing semester, confused on what to do next with my life and with no confidence left in me, just the desire to live and to actually make this life work. But now I was being forced to think about my life, to dig deep inside my soul, and make a decision quickly.\nThese were really enticing jobs but a voice inside me was starting to shout; it was already pounding my chest and it was grabbing my hand forcing me to listen.\nI wanted to be a Social Studies Teacher, yes. I wanted to be an Academic, yes.\nBut I wanted to be more.\nBut I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet.\nAnd to search for it, I needed time.\nLots and lots of time.\nBeginnings of Nonconformity (March 2014) #What I did next was the first sign of unconventionality I saw in me in many years.\nIn my entire life, I followed what was told to me. I obeyed despite a desire to question and to do my own thing. For many years I conformed and thus made people around me happy.\nBut with two traditional jobs that could potentially jump start my career in teaching, what I did was the craziest thing I did for a long time.\nI did not show up on the day of the interview and I did not follow up my interest on applying at Los Baños.\nYup. Crazy me.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t told this to anyone before, until now. And I know that some of my most well-intentioned friends and family members might think I am irresponsible with what I did.\n\u0026ldquo;Sayang\u0026rdquo; they might think.\nAnd I understand them for thinking so.\nBelieve me, there were nights after what I did when I would just lie down on my bed, look at the ceiling, and torture myself. \u0026ldquo;What was I thinking? What have I done?\u0026rdquo; I would ask.\nBut then again I remember how life became brutal to me in the past years, how early I suffered from something I think I did not deserve, and how painful it was not to live according to what my heart is telling me.\nI reminded myself that when I asked my father if he could allow me to pursue my ministry instead of my college degree on that October night of 2010, I cried. I cried so hard that I fell into a terrible depression the following year—a depression that led to chronic dysthymia and other overwhelming problems, a depression that I have to contend with every single day.\nI reminded myself that it is my right—and indeed everyone\u0026rsquo;s right—to do what he knows is best for himself.\nI knew deep inside me that I have to go into intense introspection, self-analysis, and meditation to achieve clarity on what I want to do next in life and to emerge completely from what happened to me back in 2011.\nI think I deserve all the time to find my passion.\nToday as I look back to that crazy decision of pursuing my search for passion, I realize that that very idea brought me out of depression more than the drugs or the psychiatrists did.\nIn the past months that I have been living my life as a writer, the symptoms of my depression and anxiety have subsided in ways I never thought possible. Back when I struggled with my depression, I didn\u0026rsquo;t like to do anything, a day was torture, and all I did was to lie down on my bed and watch television. But today, I wake up excited every morning because I have another article to write or another project to plan, or another idea to develop. It\u0026rsquo;s just amazing. Just simply amazing. The pursuit of happiness cures all things.\nIntense Introspection and A New Belief System (April 2014) #After my decision to not follow through with the vacant positions, PMHA finally called me and said I could start writing their history again and archiving their documents.\nI think this was good news because aside from the evening English classes, I had a new source of income, which I could tap into while investing a lot of time in introspection and learning.\nSo I did the PMHA job during the afternoon then I taught English in the evening while I pursued self-learning in the morning.\nThis set up worked so well for me that I was able to read lots of books more than I was able to do in my entire four and a half years in college. I was able to rekindle my lost passion for reading and learning.\nI noticed that when I was in control of what I put inside my brain, I easily remember what I read and I strive to apply what I was learning.\nThis is one of the many self-discoveries I was able to find through reading and meditating.\nAfter reading books in the morning, I would ride my bicycle in the late afternoon and stop in front of rice fields, breathe and just digest everything I learned.\nThrough my intense introspection, I learned that I was naturally inquisitive and nonconforming. I realized that I was able to be a young pastor at the church which I left because I repeatedly challenged my own beliefs, question what was taught to me by Christianity, and validated everything through research and empirical evidence. Finally, I gave up believing after my core values were no longer aligned with what the bigger pastors were telling.\nThrough my reading, I discovered that there was a large number of people who would actually praise individuals that left their jobs to pursue their passions, that there were many successful people in the world today who faced very similar dilemmas that I currently face, and that it was okay to challenge the status quo.\nBy this time, I learned the power of the internet and social media to build the person you want to be and to find accountability and impact other people for doing so.\nStarting and Failing and Starting Again (May 2014) #After reading a lot on alternative lifestyle design, I bought a domain name and applied for self-hosting to venture into blogging.\nThe blogosphere just doesn\u0026rsquo;t fail to amaze me on how successful it is in amplifying the voice of ordinary people, in helping individuals build relationships with like-minded peers from other parts of the planet, and in providing the tools for everyone to create their own platforms.\nSo after getting a lot of inspiration and tips from bloggers that I follow, I designed and launched this website to see where it would bring me.\nCreating and launching this website taught me a lot of things about life.\nWell, among many things, it taught me how clouded my brain was. Until I started brainstorming the content and direction of this blog, I never realized how much crap has filled my consciousness that all the creativity I once had was almost all gone.\nThe first domain name I bought was actually different from what I am using right now. I bought \u0026ldquo;DailyPolymathy.com,\u0026rdquo; which I planned to use to talk about how I would pursue my different passions but later on, I found myself feeling empty and uninspired with the subject matter. That happened after a month or so of intense brainstorming with all the papers filled with doodles and scribbles and mind maps of what I planned to do with my platform!\nI instead followed what resonated more in my heart and embraced the advice of Dave Ursillo to be \u0026ldquo;unapologetically me.\u0026rdquo; So I bought \u0026ldquo;VincentImbat.com\u0026rdquo; and started writing about my life and my story.\nI consider this my first failure and my first taste of starting all over again. And in the next post, I will be writing about more failures and mishaps I did this year.\nBut it is what taking risks is all about. It\u0026rsquo;s about building up that pile of failure and being proud of it. It\u0026rsquo;s about getting out of your comfort zone and doing something you completely don\u0026rsquo;t know. It\u0026rsquo;s about planning as you go and get your hands dirty.\nThat is what creates the better person you ought to be.\nThat is what creates the person within you that you will always be proud of.\n","date":"1 June 2014","permalink":"/essays/2013-2014-annual-review/","section":"Essays","summary":"","title":"My 2013–2014 Annual Review"},{"content":"I’m a Los Baños-based writer and photographer who walks. # Contact or Follow # Email: vince@vinceimbat.com Instagram: @vinceimbat Subscribe to my newsletter # The Long Walk, features essays on walking, literature, photography, and spirituality.

The more contemporary works of George M. Williams, Andrew James Brown, and a small community called Kiitsu Kyōkai (of which I’m a part of) are among the few things that breathe life to this long since overlooked religious and spiritual viewpoint.\nCurrent interpretations of jiyū shūkyō take inspiration from the few writings that Imaoka Shin’ichirō left, particularly his \u0026ldquo;Principles of Living,\u0026rdquo; a short document made of tentative affirmations, which practitioners are encouraged to customize for their own unique spiritual expression.\nThis cultivation of one’s individual unique, creative, and autonomous spiritual expression while recognizing that such autonomy could only be possible through embracing one’s interconnection with others—one’s neighbors whether human or non-human—is, I think, what is at the core of jiyū shūkyō.\nI found jiyū shūkyō after a 22-kilometer walk I did on June 9, 2022, from my current town of residence (Los Baños, Laguna) to San Pablo City. The strenuous yet meditative nature of that long walk moved me to finally confront my personal history as a former minister of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, a confrontation I detailed in my essay “Traversing Liminality Through Walking: An Auto-Ethnography”, which landed me a spot at the 20th Ateneo National Writers Workshop.\nBefore this walk, I’ve tried so hard to avoid my religious past, thinking it is a period of my life no longer of use to me. However, as I wrote in the essay, what walking does is perform one’s internal condition of being in-between spaces so that one could experience and perhaps finally see the distance between one’s former self and present self, a moment that, with faith, leads to integration.\nWhat walking has helped me perceive is that the past is not something to avoid but is something that holds a few useful things to create and give meaning to my present reality. Walking helped me realize that despite not being affiliated to any formal religion I am still very interested in questions about reality, meaning, and being in the world. In short, I was and always is spiritual. Stumbling upon jiyū shūkyō through Andrew James Brown’s blog Caute was the balm to my existential illness.\nI’m still in the process of deepening my understanding of jiyū shūkyō and I don’t have all the answers, but I try to write whatever I learn so I could share them to others. Some of my essays on the subject that others found helpful are:\nA Goodness Lurking: The Quest for a Free, Subsistent Spirituality Where the Sun Warms: Nietzsche’s Prognosis for Existential Illness A Sunday Walk Walking # I’ve always walked. Growing up as a Jehovah’s Witness, it was something I just did. In college when I really started to go deep in the religion of my childhood, I volunteered in a sign language congregation that ministered to the deaf and hard of hearing in Baguio City. There I became a minister and young pastor. Part of my duties was to walk miles and miles around the hills of Baguio and nearby municipalities to search for deaf or hard of hearing individuals we could preach to. After I left the Jehovah’s Witnesses in 2012, I used walking to grieve and begin creating my path ahead.\nWhile finding my way around different spiritual circles, I fell in love with Henry David Thoreau. I read his journals and started translating some of my favorite entries. I also started experimenting with walking as a spiritual practice and a platform for writing. Walking in the afternoons along dirt paths cutting through rice fields in my hometown of San Jacinto, Pangasinan, I developed an intimate relationship with my feet.\nEncountering the Japan-based writer and photographer Craig Mod in 2021 inspired me to move beyond Thoreau and consider other ways of fusing walking, writing, and photography. Aside from my first long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo in 2022, I also did other walks:\n2023 April 20 and 27: \u0026ldquo;Nasa Labas ang Ili\u0026rdquo; (Home is Out There) guided walk 2023 December 4–10: Roots ྾ Gravel: A Week-long Walk of Los Baños 2024 January 15–21: Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1 2024 March 5–6: Walking Binondo As of now, I’m continuing my study of walking as a method and platform for thinking and creativity. I’m particularly interested on how the contemporary dérive as theorized by Phil Smith sits alongside Filipino indigenous conceptions and experiences of walking and how these embodied acts could serve as platforms for exploring jiyū shūkyō (or variants of it) in the Philippines.\nIn November 2024, the Katipunan journal published my hybrid (draft) poetry collection Mapa ng Los Baños Patungo Sa\u0026rsquo;yo (A Map of Los Baños to You) in its Buhian literary issue. In the essay that accompanied the collection, \u0026ldquo;Ang Borador Bilang Panitikan ng Paglalakad\u0026rdquo; (The Draft as a Literature for Walking), I delved into my intimate history with walking and discussed how I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a walking practice that fuels my writing and spiritual life.\nIn the same year, I wrote an essay in Pangasinan entitled \u0026ldquo;Ikurit Ko\u0026rsquo;y Sali-salik ëd Sayan Dalin: Pitoran Akar\u0026rdquo; (I Will Write My Feet on This Land: Seven Walks), which won in the 2024 Gawad Bienvenido Lumbera. The essay introduces seven of the more than a hundred Pangasinan words refering to walking I discovered in the Spanish-era Cosgaya dictionary. I then used these words as prompts for recollections of several walks I\u0026rsquo;ve done in Pangasinan, my home province, including my first walk as a child, my first funeral procession, and the walks I did as a youth preaching the Bible with my parents.\nWriting #I was very fortunate to grow up in a household with books. By high school I had a decent handle of both English and Filipino I could express myself in these languages. That said, my earlier relationship with writing in the context of traditional schooling was mired with competition, heartbreaks, and insecurities.\nAs a religious minister using sign language as my primary mode of communication, I wrote almost nothing. When I left the religion of my childhood I noticed I started writing once more but with a very different intention. I wrote only for myself under the private pages of my journal to help me understand what I was going through and to chart a course for the life ahead. In a way, writing was like walking with pen and paper.\nAs of now, I’m experimenting with what I call the talahardin (literally, “note garden”), a digital archive of my essays, notes, poems, quotes, stories, translations, vignettes, and other “species of thought” in different states of development. I see my talahardin as my body of work. As an archive, everything it contains are drafts as it itself is a draft. Seeing my body of work as a draft is anchored on the idea that art is never finished, which means that like one’s state during a walk, I see my art as being in a perpetual state of liminality. Because of this, I put priority on the process rather than the product of my writing. I have sympathies with the process movement in literature, particularly the work of Pat Schneider and her Amherst Writers and Artists (AWA) method.\nPhotography #My interest with photography has always been driven by my desire to deepen my walks. My walks require me to look closer at objects and to look underneath what seems apparent in the landscape or the street. Photography, particularly the practice of contemplative photography I first learned from Louise Far seems to help me with both goals.\nMy walks and photography work hand in hand. Almost all my photographs are taken during my walks.\nAs of now, I’m also exploring how jiyū shūkyō could be practiced through photography. In thinking about photography this way, I take inspiration from a quote from Andrew James Brown\u0026rsquo;s essay \u0026ldquo;The Freedom to Be Tomorrow What We Are Not Today\u0026rdquo;:\nI always try to pick up my camera and go out into the world without a ready-made, fully worked-out blueprint, theory or plan about how, when or where to take a photograph. In this sense, what the surfboard is to the surfer, the camera is to me the photographer. In doing this I’m attempting to keep myself open to whatever whooshes-up or shines before me, whether that is in the form of an obvious “subject”, “view”, or a simple passing play of sunlight and shadow. When something does whoosh-up or shines before me, I stop and take a photograph. To do this I must, of course, temporarily “take a position.” Not only by standing still in this or that place but also by taking a position with regard to the camera settings I am going to use, the f-stop, the shutter speed, film speed and whether to shoot in black and white or colour. Now, were I never to take this or that position with regard to all these things, I would never be able to take any photo (good or bad). However, it is vitally important that, having taken a photograph, I never become wholly wedded to this or that particular position, subject, view, passing play of sunlight and shadow or this or that set of settings—instead, I must move on, intra-actively, on the crest of the unfolding world, to attain another perspective and so allow something else to whoosh-up or shine before me which calls me to shoot, click!\nLet’s Keep in Touch #I created this website to share my work and in the process find fellow companions in this journey.

The zine was an experimental project that used walking as a method and platform for writing epistolary essays. The process was simple: Jesa walked around Cagayan de Oro City while I walked around Los Baños. During or after each walk, we wrote letters to each other. We sent and read each other\u0026rsquo;s letters only after the experiment ended. We then processed everything through a written dialogue, which became an afterword.\nThe experiment was surprisingly demanding. The letters crawled into diverse subjects—body, gender, religion, mental health, grief, poetry—and bordered into confessions.
