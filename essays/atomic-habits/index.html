To establish habits that reinforce one&rsquo;s desired identity, Clear suggests that these habits should be: (1) made obvious, (2) made attractive, (3) made easy, and (4) made satisfying. On the other hand, to break habits that do not support one&rsquo;s desired identity, Clear argues that these habits should be: (1) made invisible, (2) made unattractive, (3) made hard, and (4) made unsatisfying. Clear ties these four laws and their inversions together with strategies like environment design, habit tracking, and deliberate practice to create a full-proof system for building good habits and breaking bad ones.</p><h3 id=introduction-my-story class="relative group">Introduction: My Story <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#introduction-my-story aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h3><p>Successful habit change creates a sense of control over your life, which in turn creates self-confidence.</p><p>Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.</p><p>We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.</p><p>James Clear&rsquo;s strategy involves: small habits, gradual evolution, and long series of small wins and tiny breakthroughs.</p><p>James Clear&rsquo;s four-step model of habits: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p><p>James Clear’s four laws of behavior change evolved out of the four steps above.</p><p>James Clear’s framework is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. It accounts for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits.</p><p>Human behavior is always changing, but the fundamentals of human behavior do not change. They are lasting principles you can rely on. They are ideas you can build a business, family, and life around.</p><h2 id=the-fundamentals-why-tiny-changes-make-a-big-difference class="relative group">The Fundamentals: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#the-fundamentals-why-tiny-changes-make-a-big-difference aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><h3 id=chapter-one-the-surprising-power-of-atomic-habits class="relative group">Chapter One: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#chapter-one-the-surprising-power-of-atomic-habits aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h3><p><strong>The Aggregation of Marginal Gains.</strong> Break down everything you could think of that goes into what you do + improve it by 1 percent = significant increase when you put them all together.</p><p><strong>Habits are an investment.</strong> Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.</p><p><strong>Success is the product of daily habits, not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.</strong> The small choices you take concerning your habits determine the difference between who you are and who you could be.</p><p><strong>Focus on your current trajectory, not your current results.</strong> It doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.</p><p><strong>Habits are a double-edged sword.</strong> You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.</p><p><strong>The Plateau of Latent Potential.</strong> Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. In order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. It will pay off after a certain amount.</p><p><strong>Habits are like trees.</strong> The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us. The task of building a good habit is like cultivating a delicate flower one day at a time.</p><p><strong>Forget about goals; focus on systems instead.</strong> Results had very little to do with the goals you set and nearly everything to do with the systems you follow. Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are best for making progress.</p><p><strong>Improve for good by solving problems at the systems level.</strong> Results are not the problem. We don’t have to change the results. What we need to change are the systems that lead to the results.</p><p><strong>When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy.</strong> You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.</p><p><strong>Do not restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success.</strong> A system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</p><p><strong>It is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.</strong> True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment.

What is punished is avoided.</p><p>We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Immediate-return environment.</strong> Your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.</p><p><strong>Delayed-return environment.</strong> You work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.</p><p>The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment.</p><p>You value the present more than the future.</p><p>With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad.With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.</p><p>The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions.</p><p>The more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.</p><p><strong>Updated Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:</strong> What is <em>immediately</em> rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</p><p>If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff.</p><p>At decisive moments, add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and add a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p><p><strong>The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful even if it’s in a small way.</strong> To stay on track, you need immediate rewards. They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.</p><p><strong>Reinforcement.</strong> Ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish, thus increasing the rate of a behavior.</p><p><strong>Use reinforcement when dealing with habits of avoidance.</strong> Whenever you resist temptation, give yourself and immediate reward. This makes avoidance visible and makes doing nothing satisfying.</p><p>Select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it.</p><p><strong>Identity can become a reinforcer.</strong> Eventually, as intrinsic rewards kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you.</p><p>It takes time for evidence to accumulate and a new identity to emerge.</p><p>Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.</p><h3 id=chapter-sixteen-how-to-stick-with-good-habits-every-day class="relative group">Chapter Sixteen: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#chapter-sixteen-how-to-stick-with-good-habits-every-day aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h3><p>Visual measures reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.</p><p><strong>Habit tracker.</strong> A simple way to measure whether you did a habit. Basic format: Get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine.</p><p><strong>Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change.</strong> Habit tracking simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.</p><p><strong>Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.</strong> Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day.</p><p><strong>Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.</strong> The most effective form of motivation is progress. Through habit tracking, each small win feeds your desire.</p><p><strong>Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.</strong> Tracking can become its own form of reward. It is satisfying to mark an X on the calendar.</p><p>Habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.</p><p>How to make tracking easier?</p><ul><li>Whenever possible, measurement should be automated.</li><li>Manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.</li><li>Record each measurement immediately after a habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down.</li></ul><p>The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].</p><p>Every habit streak ends at some point.

A verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you. It adds a social cost to any behavior because it makes the costs of violating promises public and painful.</p><p><strong>Having an accountability parter is helpful.</strong> Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. Knowing that you will fail to uphold your promises to others is an immediate punishment.
