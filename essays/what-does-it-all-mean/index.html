Nagel believes that engaging with these questions directly is the best way to start a study of philosophy. He introduces the beginning philosopher to the questions and the most common arguments about them. Within his discussion, Nagel also inserts his own stand on the problems but cautions the reader not to rely on his conclusions. Instead, he repeatedly encourages the reader to think through the questions using her own reasoning.</p><h2 id=chapter-one-introduction class="relative group">Chapter One: Introduction <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#chapter-one-introduction aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p><strong>Chapter Summary: Philosophy is best studied by engaging with the philosophical questions first before anything else.</strong></p><ul><li>Begin your study of philosophy by thinking about the questions directly. Examine some possible solutions and look for their pitfalls. Do this and you will be in a better position to read the works of others.</li><li>Philosophy is different from science or mathematics because it does not rely on experiments or formal methods of proof.</li><li>The main concern of philosophy is to question and understand the very common ideas that we take for granted.</li><li>Philosophy can be difficult because the more basic the ideas one is trying to investigate, the fewer the available tools. A philosopher cannot assume too much. A philosopher can&rsquo;t take things for granted.</li></ul><h2 id=chapter-two-how-do-we-know-anything class="relative group">Chapter Two: How Do We Know Anything? <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#chapter-two-how-do-we-know-anything aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p><strong>Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of how you know anything, ponder on (1) whether there is really a physical world outside your mind or if your mind is the only thing that exists, and (2) consider whether or not it is all right to go on believing on an external world even if it does not exist.</strong></p><ul><li>The inside of your own mind is the only thing you can be sure of.</li><li>To conclude that a physical world outside your mind because you &ldquo;sense&rdquo; it is a weak proposition. Trying to prove the reliability of your senses by appealing to your senses is circular reasoning.</li><li>Ponder on this: What if all your experiences are just a giant dream with no external world outside it?</li><li>If the &ldquo;giant dream&rdquo; exists, then any evidence you use to prove that there is a physical world outside your mind will just really be part of the &ldquo;giant dream.&rdquo;</li><li>All evidence about what could be an outside world should come through your mind.</li><li>Ponder on this: Maybe, there is no physical world outside your mind. Maybe, only you, the subject of experience, is the one that exists.</li><li>&ldquo;Solipsism&rdquo; is the view that your mind is the only thing that exists.</li><li>Solipsism is a conclusion that is more than the evidence warrants.</li><li>Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s position: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything beyond your impressions and experiences.&rdquo; This position is also called &ldquo;skepticism.&rdquo;</li><li>A stronger form of skepticism proposes that you can&rsquo;t be sure that you existed in the past because all you have to go on are the present contents of your mind.</li><li>Argument: &ldquo;There is a physical world outside your mind because your internal experiences have external causes.&rdquo; Skeptic&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;Even if external causes exist, they cannot be observed directly. They have to go through the mind. How can you be sure about their properties and existence?&rdquo;</li><li>Science doesn&rsquo;t hold the final answer to whether or not there is a physical world outside your mind. Science relies on observation through the senses. If we can&rsquo;t establish the reliability of our senses, we can&rsquo;t establish the reliability of science.</li><li>Verificationism is the belief that without the possibility of a correct view of how things are, the thought that one&rsquo;s impressions are not true is meaningless.</li><li>According to verificationism, if a physical world outside your mind does not exist, then what seems to be an illusion is actually perceptions of reality. Verificationism requires that reality is what we can observe.</li><li>&ldquo;Egocentric predicament&rdquo; is the problem of not being able to see reality as it is because of being trapped inside one&rsquo;s mind.</li><li>It is difficult to escape our acceptance of the existence of a physical world outside our minds.</li></ul><h2 id=chapter-three-other-minds class="relative group">Chapter Three: Other Minds <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#chapter-three-other-minds aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p><strong>Chapter Summary: To solve the problem of whether or not other minds exist, (1) explore what you can really know beyond the contents of your mind, and (2) consider the possibility that there might be much less or much more conscious life than you assume.</strong></p><ul><li>The only experience you can actually have is your own.</li><li>Your belief that other people have their own experiences is based on your observation of their behavior. You can&rsquo;t enter their minds and experience it yourself.</li><li>It is uncertain whether two human beings could have the same exact experience.</li><li>Physical differences and other factors may contribute to differences in experience.</li><li>The differences in sensual experiences among human beings may or may not be radical. We can&rsquo;t know 100%.</li><li>The experiences of human beings could be entirely different among each other.</li><li>Radical conclusion: Because you can&rsquo;t experience other people&rsquo;s mental lives directly, it is plausible to conclude that other minds do not exist.</li><li>If other minds do not exist, their physical behavior is caused by physical factors.</li><li>You can&rsquo;t be sure 100% that other minds exist just because other people act and talk. You don&rsquo;t see the connection between other people&rsquo;s inner experience and their behavior &ldquo;directly.&rdquo;</li><li>To &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; believe that other minds exist just because it &ldquo;seems&rdquo; obvious is to rely on instinct, not knowledge.</li><li>If you accept that there are other people who have minds, you should be ready to accept that animals, plants, cells, nonliving things, and even machines &ldquo;could&rdquo; have minds too.</li><li>The only way you can be sure that other people, other organisms, and other things have minds is to observe &ldquo;directly&rdquo; the correlations between their internal experience and their physical manifestations.

How these states interact and whether or not they are mutually exclusive is a problem that has bothered philosophers for thousands of years.</strong></p><ul><li>What happens to the mind seems to depend on what happens to the body.</li><li>Ponder this: Is your mind something different from your brain, though connected to it? Or is it part of your brain?</li><li>The mind is different from the brain because brain processes can be observed by an outsider but the mind (feelings, sensations, experiences) cannot be observed by the same outsider.</li><li>If the contents of the mind cannot be observed by an outsider in a way that she can observe the contents of the brain, then the mind cannot be a &ldquo;physical&rdquo; part or state of the brain.</li><li>&ldquo;Dualism&rdquo; is the view that a person is made up of two substances: matter and mind. Another way to put this is that a person has a body and a soul.</li><li>&ldquo;Physicalism&rdquo; also known as &ldquo;materialism&rdquo; is the view that a person consists of noting but physical matter. Therefore, the mind and its contents are simply physical states of the brain. There is only the body, there is no soul.</li><li>&ldquo;Dual aspect theory&rdquo; is an alternative to both dualism and physicalism. It is the view that a brain is an object with both physical and mental properties.</li><li>Mental states can&rsquo;t simply be explained by purely physical causes and effects. Mental states &ldquo;feel&rdquo; a certain way that is different from a physical phenomenon.</li><li>Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s position: There is a physical reality that people can observe from the outside. There is a mental reality that individuals experience from the inside. This mental reality could also occur to other organisms.</li><li>To have a purely physical theory about the mind and the body, and therefore the entire universe, the mind or consciousness has to be identified with some physical state.</li><li>So far, it is impossible to have a unified physical theory of the universe because arguments against it are strong enough to refute it.</li></ul><h2 id=chapter-five-the-meaning-of-words class="relative group">Chapter Five: The Meaning of Words <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style=text-decoration-line:none!important href=#chapter-five-the-meaning-of-words aria-label=Anchor>#</a></span></h2><p><strong>Chapter Summary: Words allow us to understand the universe, communicate with each other, and invent things. But it is a mystery how words have this incredible power.</strong></p><ul><li>There is no resemblance between a word and its referent. The relationship of a word to its referent is indirect.</li><li>But you cannot understand a word by itself. In order to understand a word, you need to see or know its referent.</li><li>We use other words to give a word meaning, a definition. But this could be circular reasoning. We need to get to some words that have &ldquo;direct meanings.&rdquo;</li><li>What is unusual with a word is that when you use it both in written or oral form, it refers to all the samples of its referent in the past, present, and the future.

This is usually done by taking money from the rich through various forms of taxation and giving that money to the poor in the form of welfare programs.</li><li>There is not much we can do to eradicate inequalities based on talent if we do not abolish the competitive social system itself. While this could solve the inequalities, it will incur heavy costs on freedom and efficiency.</li><li>People who are against redistributive taxation argue that economic transactions that produce inequalities are not inherently wrong and that it isn&rsquo;t right for governments to interfere on people who aren&rsquo;t deliberately hurting anyone.</li><li>Thomas Nagel&rsquo;s position: Both deliberately imposed and accidental inequalities are unfair.
