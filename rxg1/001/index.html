I remember her saying that according to the book, animals animals in nature know best how to hide survive longer than most others. After hearing this, I sometimes wondered whether I was hiding too much.</p><p>I live in the farthest unit of a four-unit apartment compound. The family at the first unit, the one nearest the gate, has been here the longest. When I first came here, they were my first friends. The father was keen on introducing himself to me when I first entered the gate. His wife warmed up with me later and gave me a bowl of kimchi she made herself. The couple had two children, both boys, one currently based in Canada, while the other lives with them. I don&rsquo;t see and talk that often with their son who lives with them, even if he seems to be the same age as me. But I often hear his name called by delivery men.</p><p>Early on, I was surprised to learn that this family was Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. I heard them singing familiar songs while passing by their unit one time in 2021 when most religious gatherings were done online. In my first year here, the father approached me and invited me to the memorial of Christ&rsquo;s death, the only religious event JWs celebrate. I took the invitation but never attended. He never sent me another the following year; until now, this family doesn&rsquo;t know that I used to be one of them.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/02-house-window.jpg data-pswp-width=1638 data-pswp-height=2048 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/02-house-window_hu_50aac768e2145607.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/02-house-window_hu_19a48dc8ec14712c.webp 660w

Even a forced one, I imagine, might bring something good.</p><p>A few months ago, I met Jhoanna Lynn Cruz, who threw herself into her own spiritual wilderness in Davao after a broken marriage. She brought with her her two children. She didn&rsquo;t know a single soul in that large city. Malaria got her son twice and made her want to give up. But she stayed.

This blood flows from my arteries to my veins when I open my eyes and get out of bed. Full of innocence, these children playing on the streets of Los Baños this early morning are the blood that flows into this town&rsquo;s arteries.</p><hr><p>And what of the sari-sari stores that are our bridge to the factories that make our food, soap, shampoo, and other things that become the cells of our body, that become, at one point, us? Do they not sustain us, too?</p><p>Last year, on the day my best friend was buried, a storm came so strong that the entire Los Baños electric power system came down for around three days. Most areas in the town also didn&rsquo;t have running water. Mt. Data Street, where I live, surprisingly, had flowing water. But that was it. We used to rely on an electric stove. Without electricity, we cannot eat. Rain was nonstop, and many of the streets I now walk lay underwater.</p><p>We got by through processed, packaged food bought in the store. This is the Philippines. This is nothing new. But it is still worth writing about.</p><p>These stores, perhaps inherited from the Chinese (but we call them the Spanish word <em>garita</em> in Pangasinan, which warrants some research), are so prevalent we&rsquo;ve refused to even think about them. We try our best to avoid them if we can. All those sachets hanging inside the sari-sari store, along with all those sugar wrapped around with colorful plastic, are more expensive by a few pesos compared to those we buy in the grocery. And yet when I&rsquo;m in the middle of a long essay that has to be written, and I&rsquo;m sleepy of hunger and no food is in the fridge, I walk toward the humble sari-sari store near my house.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/04-locked-gate.jpg data-pswp-width=1638 data-pswp-height=2048 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/04-locked-gate_hu_ef63fd7e51e0d97b.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/04-locked-gate_hu_623191668b2eca0f.webp 660w

Data Street, the white, fat dog who once stood out from all the others is now overrun by scabies. He frequently sits and turns his upper body behind his back to scratch the scabies with his mouth. He sits on clear, pristine roads, cleaned by house owners. Here in LB, the street segment in front of your house is yours. You park your car in front of it if you don&rsquo;t have a garage. If you own no car, this is still an unspoken rule: you clean the segment of that road. Walkers like me will forever thank you for it.</p><hr><p>Tiny dogs often bark at me when I walk here. They constantly remind me that I can&rsquo;t have a dog unless I want my life to get more complicated. The night I left Pangasinan to relocate to Los Baños, I left two dogs at our family&rsquo;s house in Pangasinan. I will never see one of them again.</p><p>The first place I rented while looking for a more permanent place to stay was a large room on the second floor of an apartment complex. The floor was wooden, and I smelled the cigarette smoke from the single mother renting below me.</p><p>A cat befriended me, a tilapia colored female, while there, so I felt obliged to buy food for her. Later, a second cat, a black and white female, appeared. I shooed her at first but felt bad about myself for doing so. I decided to treat them equally.</p><p>When I left that room after two months of renting and finding the unit I am now renting, I couldn&rsquo;t wrap myself around the thought of leaving the two cats. So, I took them with me. I remember hiring a tricycle driver and sitting inside while holding between my legs a large cage with the two cats loudly meowing around Lopez Ave., Santos Street, and finally Data Street. It is one of the most expensive decisions I have made with my life here. But I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve survived that first year in Los Baños without the friendship of these two cats.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/05-two-cats.jpg data-pswp-width=1638 data-pswp-height=2048 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/05-two-cats_hu_5164e4d67d921b7c.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/05-two-cats_hu_76aafff98810c32c.webp 660w

I hear the sound of the train from afar. Perhaps this is the first train to arrive today. A train arrives at 7 in the morning and 7 in the evening, with others arriving intermittently in between. Of course, the train from Manila and traverses Laguna, bound to as far as Bicol, has been passing by Los Baños for over a century. When I arrived here in 2021, there was no train, however. It only resumed operation this year, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.</p><p>When I first heard the train one morning, I was too ignorant I thought it was the water pipe in our bathroom, which sounded similar when broken. Another time, I mistook it for the sound of our blender. Only after seeing the train one evening while walking at IPB Road and hearing the same sound did I finally figure out what is too obvious to many.</p><hr><p>It rained yesterday—torrents of it. So, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting all this sun. Often, LB gives a lot of sun briefly for 30 minutes in the early morning before it rains for the entire day. The brief sun we are given in the morning is a gift. We have to wake up early just to have our clothes dried. When I see clouds beginning to move fast, I rush to the clothesline.</p><p>Hopefully, this sun lasts.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/06-white-gumamela.jpg data-pswp-width=1638 data-pswp-height=2048 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/06-white-gumamela_hu_3ec62f2f21b6f82c.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/06-white-gumamela_hu_6e935364cd343c12.webp 660w

Dorms usually have these tarps. When dorms hang these, I interpret this as them saying that, somehow, what made these good souls succeed in their studies is the warmth of their beds, the security of their rooms, the friendliness of their landlords, perhaps. Once in a while, you&rsquo;ll see one of these tarps hanging from a house or a business establishment: Son of the owner. Daughter of the owner. And you can&rsquo;t help but think, she&rsquo;s from here. She studied here, when will she ever leave?</p><p>Sometimes, I wonder which is more important for Los Baños, which brings more business to folks: the school or the baths? Living too far from the baths to feel their presence consistently, I tend to think the school is more important. But both the school and the baths have the power to draw traffic.</p><hr><p>The reason why it was so easy to adopt cats in LB is because there are too many of them on the streets it&rsquo;s almost a thing here to adopt at least one. No other place in the world has such a love of cats.</p><p>A few months ago, one of the cats inside the University of the Philippines campus got hit by a car. It died right away. Students built an altar of flowers for the cat near the spot where it got killed, which stayed there for about a week. People came by to pay their respects or to take photos. I heard they are still on a manhunt for the suspect. That is how much people love cats here.</p><p>This makes me sad when I hear that live kittens are sometimes left inside drums or under bushes, crying for days before they die. Perhaps such is the paradox of place.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/07-roof-cat.jpg data-pswp-width=1638 data-pswp-height=2048 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/07-roof-cat_hu_a167cc03210a4269.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/07-roof-cat_hu_1a8970df8d2e9d53.webp 660w

They&rsquo;re too small and yet hold too many cars. Except inside UP, most streets have no sidewalks. Even narrow streets can be surprisingly busy sometimes.</p><p>I love empty roads with no cars or those not too busy. They make me feel like they were designed especially for walkers: an oasis in a town intoxicated with cars.</p><hr><p>I reach Ruby and it is now past 8:00. I&rsquo;m no longer alone. Students walk with me, tiptoeing over wet stones and going to the road&rsquo;s edge to avoid cars and tricycles. I wish I could walk for my parents and family again like these students do now.</p><p>We pass by apartments for rent and laundry houses near them. In Banawe Street, the front yard of a house was turned into an eatery. A few blocks away at Sapphire, a family opened a restaurant in their garage. This is a town built for students. There is a budget price for almost anything. Incidentally, those who choose to live cheaply while they do their art find solace in a town made for students.</p><p>I walk slowly to savor the smell of butter on rice.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/08-slippers-door.jpg data-pswp-width=989 data-pswp-height=1237 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/08-slippers-door_hu_54a2a73283457bd6.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/08-slippers-door_hu_6f6d4fcdd7ca08b5.webp 660w

Often left outside compounds alone and only checked once a month, they are one of the loneliest objects ever invented.</p><p>In 2021, my first year here, a garbage collector stepped on my water meter to get over our fence. I bet he was eyeing to get a piece of metal or wood lying around our front yard. He never made it over the fence. Instead, he broke my water meter and my water pipe. For the next three days, I fetched water from my neighbor’s faucet while waiting for the water company to come to repair what was broken.</p><p>What was really broken was my faith in the scrap men who ride their tricycles around. It took me a while to regain my respect for them. But when I did, I started a conversation with one. It was in the middle of a tight lockdown.

The land owner was intent on making this as clear as possible that he placed tens of large concrete barrels on half of the road. This effectively deterred motorists from avoiding the road. It is a perfect reminder of how far one can go in protecting his property.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/17-barrels-road.jpg data-pswp-width=1214 data-pswp-height=1520 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/17-barrels-road_hu_40745c391ac9e2da.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/17-barrels-road_hu_bc8ccd39f13eab81.webp 660w

One of the best moments of my stay here was my first Christmas Eve morning when I heard the Imam sing.</p><p>I stopped to take a photo of the mosque, which reminded me that it took me a while before I felt comfortable pointing my camera at it. It was an afternoon last year. The imam was also singing, and the dogs were howling with him. I took my phone out of my pocket and grabbed a photo of its beautiful blue dome. I felt ashamed of fearing what was different. This is why I’m so grateful for walking. It shows me my blind spots.</p><hr><p><figure><a href=images/18-lb-mosque.jpg data-pswp-width=1317 data-pswp-height=1648 data-pswp-group=essay target=_blank><picture class="mx-auto my-0 rounded-md"><source srcset="/rxg1/001/images/18-lb-mosque_hu_e4db156f3db028d.webp 330w,/rxg1/001/images/18-lb-mosque_hu_65095895e955a37e.webp 660w
